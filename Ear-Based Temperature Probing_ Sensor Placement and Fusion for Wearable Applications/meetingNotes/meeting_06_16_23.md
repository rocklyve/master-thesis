### DONE

- TITUS: 
	- helps me with temperature sensors
	- tried to fix wrong sensor, but without success, maybe pcb design is wrong
- DYLAN: 
	- helps me with SD_Logger and temperature sensors
	- SD_Logger -> success
	- Temp-sensors -> Failure

Temperature sensors:
- defect sensor 4 (Titus and I looked at it, without success)
- works on speed, but not on openEarable (don't know why)

SD_Logging:
- Works now :) I should be able to save data now
- maybe it's interesting how to synch timestamps

3D Prints:
- AirPods design ready
- 3d Back case is ready


### TODO:

Finalize everything


### Questions: What to do with PCB?
