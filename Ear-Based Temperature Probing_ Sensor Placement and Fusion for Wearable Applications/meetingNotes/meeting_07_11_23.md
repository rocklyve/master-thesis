### DONE

- TITUS: 
	- told him to update the PCB to the v2 version.
	- tasks there: sensor cable line on bus 4 update
	- 4pin adapter -> from up to down 
	- 3 other ports on multiplexer -> point to soldering other cable lines
- DYLAN: 
	- helps me with IMU (little bit)

Temperature sensors:
- now working

3D Prints:
- AirPods print is nearly finalized
- 3d Back print is finalized for v1

How to make a study:
- this is very important
- how to start/stop a measurement
- how to sync data maybe with other data -> timestamp is relative, so not usable to sync data with
