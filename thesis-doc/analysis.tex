\section{Calibration of MLX90632 Sensors for Consistency}
In this research, multiple MLX90632 temperature sensors that are factory calibrated to have an accuracy of $\pm0.2^\circ$C are used. 
However, initial self-testing indicated that the sensors varied by as much as 1.1$^\circ$C under controlled conditions. 
To understand these discrepancies, all sensors were uniformly placed at the same distance from a temperature-controlled metal plate. 
Despite these controlled conditions, significant variations among the sensor readings were observed, underscoring the need for an internal calibration mechanism to enhance data consistency across different measurement points.
The calibration procedure is described in Chapter \ref{ch:Implementation}.
