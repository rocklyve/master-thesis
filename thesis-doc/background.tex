\section{Sensing with Earables}
Earables belong to the class of wearables and are a type of wearable device that is worn in or around the ears. 
They typically have a number of sensors that allow them to collect data about the wearer's physiology and activity. 
The most common sensors in earables include accelerometers, gyroscopes, and heart rate monitors. These sensors can be used to track the wearer's movements, monitor their heart rate, and provide other types of health data.

\section{Ear-based temperature measurement}
Ear-based temperature measurement uses a sensor to measure the temperature of the ear canal. 
The approach has a number of advantages over other measurement positions.
First, it is an non-invasive measurement procedure, which allows measurement nearly inside the body with the least amount of hematoma.
Second, the measurement is much more promising compared to other non-invasive alternatives, where many factors can contribute to falsify the final result \cite{ganioValidityReliabilityDevices2009, craigTemperatureMeasuredAxilla2000}. 
However, it is important to note that the accuracy of temperature measurement may depend on factors such as the positioning of the thermometer and the presence of earwax or other obstructions in the ear canal.

\subsection{Core Body Temperature}
Core body temperature is the temperature of the body's internal organs, such as the heart, liver and brain and is commonly used indicator of the human health and endurance performance.
Unlike the body core temperature, the body surface temperature is more easily influenced by the ambient temperature and therefore cannot reflect the changes inside the body as well as the body core temperature.
Core body temperature can be measured invasively rectally, orally (oesophagus), in the pulmonary artery (with the use of a catheter) or in the urinary bladder \cite{moranCoreTemperatureMeasurement2002a}. 
These types of measurements are uncomfortable for a person. 
In addition, because of this, it is not possible to take a measurement over a long period of time.

Body temperature can also be measured non-invasive.
This can be done on the axilla, the tympanic membrane, and the body surface \cite{moranCoreTemperatureMeasurement2002a}.

\subsubsection{Core Body Temperature Measurement on the Tympanic Membrane}
The tympanic membrane is a thin membrane that separates the middle ear from the external auditory canal. 
The artery called the external carotid artery runs near the external auditory canal and radiates heat, which is why measuring the temperature at the tympanic membrane has a promising chance of determining body temperature \cite{yeohRevisitingTympanicMembrane2017}.

\subsection{Optical temperature sensors compared to thermal resistance temperature sensors}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{thesis-doc/images/introduction/temp_sensor_types.png}
Temperature sensors are used to measure the temperature of a particular object or environment.
These are divided into 2 main categories, optical and thermal resistance sensors.
In this section, we will discuss the differences between these two types of sensors and their advantages and disadvantages.

\subsubsection{Optical Temperature Sensors}
Optical temperature sensors measure the radiation emitted from an object at different wavelengths. 
This type of sensor is typically used in applications where contact with the object being measured is difficult or impossible, such as in space, harsh environments, or just where contact is not wanted.
Thus, non-contact measurements are possible, which is essential when measuring the temperature of the tympanic membrane.
Another advantage of optical temperature sensors is that moving objects can still be measured as long as the sensor continues to point at the object.
However, this requires a line of sight to the measured object.
In addition, accuracy can be affected by reflective surfaces or atmospheric conditions, which should not be a problem if the measurement is primarily in the ear.

\subsubsection{Thermal Resistance Temperature Sensors}
Thermal resistance temperature sensors, also known as thermistors, operate by measuring changes in electrical resistance as a function of temperature. 
This type of sensor is typically used in applications where high accuracy is required, such as laboratory environments or medical equipment.
They provide high accuracy and cover a wide range of temperature measurements.
However, contact measurement is required here, which limits temperature measurement to stationary objects.
Furthermore, thermal resistance temperature sensors have a slow response time, which makes real-time measurement somewhat difficult.

In summary, optical temperature sensors are useful in situations where contact with the object being measured is difficult or impossible, while thermal resistance sensors are suitable for applications that require high accuracy and a wide temperature measurement range. 
Ultimately, the choice between these two types of sensors depends on the specific requirements of the application.

In the work applied here in the master's thesis, optical temperature sensors are suitable because they do not require direct contact points, which is essential when measuring temperature on the tympanic membrane.
