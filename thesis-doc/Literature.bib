The external ear was investigated as a novel location for a wearable device that monitors core temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) A proof of concept, called the Ear Monitor, was designed and built to test the feasibility of such a device. A trial was conducted on a group of 16 participants. Measurements were compared to benchmark measurements recorded by commercially available devices. The following results were obtained: Core temperature was measured with a mean error of 0.018 {$\pm$} 0.516 \textdegree C. Heart rate was measured with a mean error of 0.031 {$\pm$} 0.717 beats per minute. Respiratory rate was measured with a mean error of -0.558 {$\pm$} 1.406 breaths per minute. Finally, SpO2 was measured with a mean error of -0.22 {$\pm$} 1.50\%. All measurements showed statistically significant correlation with their respective benchmark measurements (p {$<$} 0.05), except for SpO2. The latter is due to the absence of measurable SpO2 variations in healthy individuals during the trial. It is concluded that the external ear is a suitable location for measuring core temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate. Further testing is needed to evaluate the SpO2 measurement capabilities of the device.},

To enable a continuous unobtrusive monitoring of core body temperature on ambulatory patients and exercising athletes, we have designed a wireless wearable system that measures the tympanic temperature inside the ear, as well as skin and environmental temperature, and that allows remote monitoring of the collected measurements. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the system and show that it can be used to identify the circadian rhythms of core body temperature, as well as to detect the variation in core body temperature due to prolonged physical exertion. We further describe the lessons learnt during a pilot deployment of our telemetric system on several athletes during the 5th L\"ubeck Marathon, and discuss the impact of environmental parameters such as temperature and wind on the accuracy and meaningfulness of the measured values.},

METHODS: After approval by the local Ethics Committee, 26 (six female and 20 male) patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were included in a single center open trial. During surgery, temperature measurements were recorded with the IRT 4000 in the left ear, and with a tympanic contact probe in the right ear, as well as with a PAC as reference. Measurements with the infrared ear thermometers and continual PAC values were recorded every six minutes. RESULTS: The average temperature measured with the IRT 4000 was 0.08 degrees C above the temperature of the PAC (95\% confidence interval from -0.44-0.61 degrees C). CONCLUSION: Infrared ear thermometers 4000 temperature readings accurately reflect body core temperature and correlate well with the invasive PAC. Infrared ear thermometers may present a clinically useful alternative to the pulmonary artery thermometry for the measurement of core temperature in the perioperative setting or in the intensive care unit.},

The proposed behind-the-ear device makes the system desirable to measure ECG data: technically less complex, physically attached to non-hair regions, hence more suitable for long term use, and user friendly as no need to undress the top garment. The proposed smart sensor device is similar to the hearing aid device and is wirelessly connected to a smartphone for physiological data transmission and displaying. This device not only gives access to the core temperature and ECG from the ear, but also the device can be controlled (removed and reapplied) by the patient at any time, thus increasing the usability of personal healthcare applications. A number of combination ECG electrodes, which are based on the area of the electrode and dry/non-dry nature of the surface of the electrodes are tested at various locations near behind the ear. The best ECG electrode is then chosen based on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the measured ECG signals. These electrodes showed acceptable SNR ratio of \textasciitilde 20 db, which is comparable with existing tradition ECG electrodes. The developed ECG electrode systems is then integrated with commercially available PPG sensor (Amperor pulse oximeter) and core body temperature sensor (MLX90614) using a specialized micro controller (Arduino UNO) and the results monitored using a newly developed smartphone (android) application.},

In this study, graphene inks were utilized to increase the accuracy of the temperature measurements from the ear by coating graphene platelets on the lens of an infrared thermopile sensor.

Raw data are continuously and wirelessly plotted on a mobile phone app. The test was performed on 10 subjects under resting and exercising in a total period of 25 min. Achieved results were compared with the commercially available Braun Thermoscan, Original Thermopile, and Cosinuss One ear thermometers. It is also comprehended that such system will be useful in personalized medicine as wearable in-ear device with wireless connectivity.},

  abstract = {Background: Wearable sensing and information and communication technologies are key enablers driving the transformation of health care delivery toward a new model of connected health (CH) care. The advances in wearable technologies in the last decade are evidenced in a plethora of original articles, patent documentation, and focused systematic reviews. Although technological innovations continuously respond to emerging challenges and technology availability further supports the evolution of CH solutions, the widespread adoption of wearables remains hindered. Methods: This study followed the scoping review methodology to identify and process the available literature. As the scope surpasses the possibilities of manual search, we relied on the natural language processing tool kit to ensure an efficient and exhaustive search of the literature corpus in three large digital libraries: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, PubMed, and Springer. The search was based on the keywords and properties to be found in articles using the search engines of the digital libraries. Results: The annual number of publications in all segments of research on wearable technology shows an increasing trend from 2010 to February 2019. The technology-related topics dominated in the number of contributions, followed by research on information delivery, safety, and security, whereas user-related concerns were the topic least addressed. The literature corpus evidences milestones in sensor technology (miniaturization and placement), communication architectures and fifth generation (5G) cellular network technology, data analytics, and evolution of cloud and edge computing architectures. The research lag in battery technology makes energy efficiency a relevant consideration in the design of both sensors and network architectures with computational offloading. The most addressed user-related concerns were (technology) acceptance and privacy, whereas research gaps indicate that more efforts should be invested into formalizing clear use cases with timely and valuable feedback and prescriptive recommendations. Conclusions: This study confirms that applications of wearable technology in the CH domain are becoming mature and established as a scientific domain. The current research should bring progress to sustainable delivery of valuable recommendations, enforcement of privacy by design, energy-efficient pervasive sensing, seamless monitoring, and low-latency 5G communications. To complement technology achievements, future work involving all stakeholders providing research evidence on improved care pathways and cost-effectiveness of the CH model is needed.},

For the early detection and prevention of heat-stroke, a wearable health monitor for in-ear use is developed which is subsequently called "Hearable". It aims to measure three vital parameters: Core body temperature, sweat rate and sweat or interstitial sodium ion (Na+) concentration. The eardrum is a good place to measure the core body temperature, because it is close to the carotid artery and the brain. We develop a hearable prototype and it consists of an audio earbud, a sensor earbud and a micro controller. Concerning the sensor earbud, a present prototype includes an eardrum (tympanic) temperature sensor and a sweat rate sensor and we implement two variants. Variant-1 focuses on the sweat rate sensing using a humidity \& temperature sensor located close to the eardrum and Variant-2 focuses on the eardrum temperature sensing using an IR temperature sensor. Concerning the sweat rate sensing, unlike conventional sweat sensors, our prototypes do not include an air flow pump, which is typically used to determine the air flow rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of sweat rate sensing based on the air flow rate measured from the evaporation of defined amount of water. We use Variant-2 to demonstrate the monitoring of the eardrum temperature and the sweat rate to differentiate a calm state and jogging.},

Facial muscle movements induce both electric field changes and physical deformations, which are detectable with electrodes placed inside the ear canal. The chosen ear-plug form factor is rather unobtrusive and allows for facial gesture recognition while utilizing the close proximity to the face. We collected 25 facial-related gestures and used them to compare the performance levels of several electric sensing technologies (EMG, CS, EFS, EarFS) with varying electrode setups. Our developed wearable fine-tuned electric field sensing employs differential amplification to effectively cancel out environmental noise while still being sensitive towards small facial-movement-related electric field changes and artifacts from ear canal deformations. By comparing a mobile with a stationary scenario, we found that EarFS continues to perform better in a mobile scenario. Quantitative results show EarFS to be capable of detecting a set of 5 facial gestures with a precision of 90\% while sitting and 85.2\% while walking. We provide detailed instructions to enable replication of our low-cost sensing device. Applying it to different positions of our body will also allow to sense a variety of other gestures and activities.},

This new platform has spurred a wealth of new research exploring what can be detected on a wearable, small form factor. As a sensing platform, the ears are less susceptible to motion artifacts and are located in close proximity to a number of important anatomical structures including the brain, blood vessels, and facial muscles which reveal a wealth of information. They can be easily reached by the hands and the ear canal itself is affected by mouth, face, and head movements. We have conducted a systematic literature review of 271 earable publications from the ACM and IEEE libraries. These were synthesized into an open-ended taxonomy of 47 different phenomena that can be sensed in, on, or around the ear. Through analysis, we identify 13 fundamental phenomena from which all other phenomena can be derived, and discuss the different sensors and sensing principles used to detect them. We comprehensively review the phenomena in four main areas of (i) physiological monitoring and health, (ii) movement and activity, (iii) interaction, and (iv) authentication and identification. This breadth highlights the potential that earables have to offer as a ubiquitous, general-purpose platform.},

We discuss the recent political initiatives designed to shift care delivery processes from paper to electronic, with the goals of more effective treatments with better outcomes; cost pressure is a major driver of innovation. We describe newly developed networks of healthcare providers, research organizations, and commercial vendors to jointly analyze data for the development of decision support systems. We address the trend toward continuous healthcare where health is monitored by wearable and stationary devices; a related development is that patients increasingly assume responsibility for their own health data. Finally, we discuss recent initiatives toward a personalized medicine, based on advances in molecular medicine, data management, and data analytics.},

  abstract = {As a result of the inefficiency of metabolic transfer, {$>$}75\% of the energy that is generated by skeletal muscle substrate oxidation is liberated as heat. During exercise, several powerful physiological mechanisms of heat loss are activated to prevent an excessive rise in body core temperature. However, a hot and humid environment can significantly add to the challenge that physical exercise imposes on the human thermoregulatory system, as heat exchange between body and environment is substantially impaired under these conditions. This can lead to serious performance decrements and an increased risk of developing heat illness. Fortunately, there are a number of strategies that athletes can use to prevent and/or reduce the dangers that are associated with exercise in the heat. In this regard, heat acclimatisation and nutritional intervention seem to be most effective. During heat acclimatisation, the temperature thresholds for both cutaneous vasodilation and the onset of sweating are lowered, which, in combination with plasma volume expansion, improve cardiovascular stability. Effective nutritional interventions include the optimisation of hydration status by the use of fluid replacement beverages. The latter should contain moderate amounts of glucose and sodium, which improve both water absorption and retention.},
