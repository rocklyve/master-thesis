  abstract = {Recognizing people by their ear has recently received significant attention in the literature. Several reasons account for this trend: first, ear recognition does not suffer from some problems associated with other non-contact biometrics, such as face recognition; second, it is the most promising candidate for combination with the face in the context of multi-pose face recognition; and third, the ear can be used for human recognition in surveillance videos where the face may be occluded completely or in part. Further, the ear appears to degrade little with age. Even though current ear detection and recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited to controlled indoor conditions. In addition to variation in illumination, other open research problems include hair occlusion, earprint forensics, ear symmetry, ear classification, and ear individuality. This article provides a detailed survey of research conducted in ear detection and recognition. It provides an up-to-date review of the existing literature revealing the current state-of-art for not only those who are working in this area but also for those who might exploit this new approach. Furthermore, it offers insights into some unsolved ear recognition problems as well as ear databases available for researchers.},

Temperatures of the pulmonary artery (PA) measured with the thermistor of right heart catheters (tempPAs) ranged from 96.5 to 102.6\r{}F, with a mean ({$\pm$} SD) of 99.3 {$\pm$} 1.1\r{}F. The intraobserver variabilities (correlation coefficients) of the tempTTs ranged from 0.90 for those measured by FNs/CCPs, to 0.92 for those measured by CCNs, to 0.98 for those measured by the CCN/Ed. Accuracy, arbitrarily defined as within a deviation of {$\pm$} 0.5\r{}F of the tempPA, was 100\% for the rectal mercury thermometer and 98.0\% for the infrared TT when used by the CCN/Ed. The accuracy of the infrared TT was 80\% when measured by CCNs and 61\% when measured by FNs/CCPs. Differences between tempPAs and tempTTs measured by the CCN/Ed ranged from 0 to 0.7\r{}F, with a mean of 0.2\r{}F. Similarly, differences between tempPAs and tempTTs measured by CCNs ranged from 0 to 2.4\r{}F, with a mean difference of 0.3\r{}F. However, differences between tempPAs and tempTTs measured by FNs/CCPs ranged from 0 to 3.0\r{}F, with a mean of 0.6\r{}F (greater differences than those obtained by the CCNs; p {$<$} 0.01). The accuracy of rectal mercury thermometry was 100\%. If a temperature {$\geq$} 101.0\r{}F had been considered as the threshold at which a fever is present, and if the mean of three measurements had been used to designate temperature, workups that were either inappropriately performed or omitted would have resulted from 2\% of tempTTs measured by the CCN/Ed, 1\% of those measured by CCNs, and 4\% of those measured by FNs/CCPs.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusion{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}When used properly, both tympanic and rectal thermometry are very accurate.

To provide a continuous estimate of core body temperature, previous approaches have focused on embedding sensors or designing forehead patches that use single or dual heat flows. This work proposes a foam-based Y-shaped sensor with flexible electronics and focuses on the ergonomic aspect. We developed a laboratory setup to derive the heat-flow parameters then tested the sensor on 10 volunteers who wore it on two locations: the forehead and behind their ear (mastoid area). An existing zero-heat-flux sensor (SpotOn by 3M) was used as reference. The sensor had an average heat-up time of 7.7 minutes and a mean error of 0.10 \textdegree C for the forehead and a heat-up time of 6.9 minutes for the mastoid area with a mean error of 0.03 \textdegree C. This ergonomic sensor has the potential for continuous core body temperature measurement for mobile patients. The next steps include testing the sensor in a hospital environment and validating it with respect to standard core body temperature sensors, such as esophageal or rectal probes.},

  abstract = {Measuring gait asymmetry is an important feature when characterizing functional imbalance between limbs. This could be due to pathologies, such as osteoarthritis, stroke, or associated with the effects of surgeries such as hip arthroplasty. Generally, the study of asymmetry or imbalance has required the use of a gait lab or force plates, which could be expensive and difficult to use in home settings. This work validates the use of a light weight ear sensor (7.4 g) with an instrumented treadmill for 64 subjects (age (60.04 (15.36)) including healthy subjects (14) as well as subjects who had been treated for hip (17), knee-replacement surgery (21) and knee osteoarthritis (12). Subjects performed treadmill walking at several speeds on flat surfaces, inclines and declines. Accelerometer data from the ear sensor were segmented into consecutive steps and temporal features were extracted. The measures of gait cycle time and step-period asymmetry obtained from the ear sensor matched well those of the treadmill for flat surfaces, inclines and declines. The key implication of the study is that the proposed method could replace expensive equipment for monitoring temporal gait features in clinics as well as free-living environments, which is important for monitoring rehabilitation after surgery and the progress of diseases affecting limb imbalance.},

Thirty-four healthy subjects were asked to progress up to their maximum walking speed on the treadmill (starting at 5km/h, with 0.5km increments). The sensor houses a 3D accelerometer which measures medio-lateral (ML), vertical (VT) and anterior\textendash posterior (AP) acceleration. Maximum signal ranges and zero crossings were derived from accelerometer signals per axis, having corrected for head motion and signal noise. The maximal force, measured by the instrumented treadmill correlated best with a combination of VT and AP acceleration (R-squared=0.36, p=0), and combined VT, ML, and AP acceleration (R-squared=0.36, p=0). Weight-acceptance peak force and impulse values also correlated well with VT and AP acceleration (Weight acceptance: R-squared=0.35, p=0, Impulse: 0.26, p=0), and combined VT, ML, and AP acceleration (Weight acceptance: R-squared=0.35, p=0, Impulse: 0.26, p=0). Zero crossing features on the ML axis provided an accurate prediction of the gait-cycle, with a mean difference of 0.03s (-0.01, 0.05 confidence intervals).},

This paper discusses a preliminary study to develop a wearable device that is a low cost, single channel, dry contact, in-ear EEG suitable for non-intrusive monitoring. All aspects of the designs, engineering, and experimenting by applying machine learning for emotion classification, are covered. Based on the valence and arousal emotion model, the device is able to classify basic emotion with 71.07\% accuracy (valence), 72.89\% accuracy (arousal), and 53.72\% (all four emotions). The results are comparable to those measured from the more conventional EEG headsets at T7 and T8 scalp positions. These results, together with its earphone-like wearability, suggest its potential usage especially for future healthcare applications, such as home-based or tele-monitoring systems as intended.},

Validity of field expedient devices to assess core temperature during exercise in the cold. Aviat Space Environ Med 2011; 82:1098\textendash 1103. Introduction: Exposure to cold environments affects human performance and physiological function. Major medical organizations recommend rectal temperature (TREC) to evaluate core body temperature (TCORE) during exercise in the cold; however, other field expedient devices claim to measure TCORE. The purpose of this study was to determine if field expedient devices provide valid measures of TCORE during rest and exercise in the cold.  Methods:  Participants included 13 men and 12 women (age = 24 {$\pm$} 3 yr, height = 170.7 {$\pm$} 10.6 cm, mass = 73.4 {$\pm$} 16.7 kg, body fat = 18 {$\pm$} 7\%) who reported being healthy and at least recreationally active. During 150 min of cold exposure, subjects sequentially rested for 30 min, cycled for 90 min (heart rate = 120\textendash 140 bpm), and rested for an additional 30 min. Investigators compared aural (TAUR), expensive axillary (TAXLe), inexpensive axillary (TAXLi), forehead (TFOR), gastrointestinal (TGI), expensive oral (TORLe), inexpensive oral (TORLi), and temporal (TTEM) temperatures to TREC every 15 min. Researchers used mean difference between each device and TREC (i.e., mean bias) as the primary criterion for validity.  Results:  TAUR, TAXLe, TAXLi, TFOR, TORLe, TORLi, and TTEM provided significantly lower measures compared to TREC and fell below our validity criterion. TGI significantly exceeded TREC at three of eleven time points, but no significant difference existed between mean TREC and TGI across time. Only TGI achieved our validity criterion and compared favorably to TREC.  Conclusion:  TGI offers a valid measurement with which to assess TCORE during rest and exercise in the cold; athletic trainers, mountain rescuers, and military medical personnel should avoid other field expedient devices in similar conditions.},

  abstract = {Emotions and temperature are closely related through embodied processes, and people seem to associate temperature concepts with emotions. While this relationship is often evidenced by everyday language (e.g., cold and warm feelings), what remains missing to date is a systematic study that holistically analyzes how and why people associate specific temperatures with emotions. The present research aimed to investigate the associations between temperature concepts and emotion adjectives on both explicit and implicit levels. In Experiment 1, we evaluated explicit associations between twelve pairs of emotion adjectives derived from the circumplex model of affect, and five different temperature concepts ranging from 0\textdegree C to 40\textdegree C, based on responses from 403 native speakers of four different languages (English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese). The results of Experiment 1 revealed that, across languages, the temperatures were associated with different regions of the circumplex model. The 0\textdegree C and 10\textdegree C were associated with negative-valanced, low-arousal emotions, while 20\textdegree C was associated with positive-valanced, low-to-medium-arousal emotions. Moreover, 30\textdegree C was associated with positive-valanced, high-arousal emotions; and 40\textdegree C was associated with high-arousal and either positive- or negative-valanced emotions. In Experiment 2 (N = 102), we explored whether these temperature-emotion associations were also present at the implicit level, by conducting Implicit Association Tests (IATs) with temperature words (cold and hot) and opposing pairs of emotional adjectives for each dimension of valence (Unhappy/Dissatisfied vs. Happy/Satisfied) and arousal (Passive/Quiet vs. Active/Alert) on native English speakers. The results of Experiment 2 revealed that participants held implicit associations between the word hot and positive-valanced and high-arousal emotions. Additionally, the word cold was associated with negative-valanced and low-arousal emotions. These findings provide evidence for the existence of temperature-emotion associations at both explicit and implicit levels across languages.},

In addition, research has begun to identify reasons for selective vulnerability to chronic stress. One of the possible reasons for chronic stress following traumatic events is the disorganizing effect of loss of control and violation of expectations for regulating aspects of one's life normally under control. Data from a longitudinal study of chronic stress at Three Mile Island in the wake of the nuclear accident there suggest that loss of control and frequent experience of intrusive memories about the accident and its aftermath were related to persistent stress responding several years after the accident. The relationships between stress responding and conditioning and consolidation of stressful memories are considered as a basis for persistent intrusive memories and chronic stress.},

The external ear was investigated as a novel location for a wearable device that monitors core temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) A proof of concept, called the Ear Monitor, was designed and built to test the feasibility of such a device. A trial was conducted on a group of 16 participants. Measurements were compared to benchmark measurements recorded by commercially available devices. The following results were obtained: Core temperature was measured with a mean error of 0.018 {$\pm$} 0.516 \textdegree C. Heart rate was measured with a mean error of 0.031 {$\pm$} 0.717 beats per minute. Respiratory rate was measured with a mean error of -0.558 {$\pm$} 1.406 breaths per minute. Finally, SpO2 was measured with a mean error of -0.22 {$\pm$} 1.50\%. All measurements showed statistically significant correlation with their respective benchmark measurements (p {$<$} 0.05), except for SpO2. The latter is due to the absence of measurable SpO2 variations in healthy individuals during the trial. It is concluded that the external ear is a suitable location for measuring core temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate. Further testing is needed to evaluate the SpO2 measurement capabilities of the device.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Optimum detection of hypothermia in athletes during outdoor exposure events remains controversial. The aims of this study were firstly to assess whether temperature readings affected competitor discharge from the treatment station and secondly to assess agreement between oral and tympanic thermometer measurements. METHODS: All competitors treated for symptomatic hypothermia at an outdoor endurance event in the United Kingdom during January 2009 were included. Temperature readings were taken using oral (Digitemp digital oral thermometer) and tympanic (Braun Thermoscan IRT 4520 ExacTemp) thermometers, with a temperature {$<$}35 degrees C classifying hypothermia. RESULTS: From 4700 competitors, 64 (1.4\%) were treated for symptomatic hypothermia. Of these, 92\% were male, the mean age was 26 years, and the mean treatment time was 25 minutes. There was no severe/life-threatening hypothermia, and no competitors required transport to a hospital for hypothermia. At discharge, 19\% of competitors were still classed as hypothermic in the oral group and 28\% in the tympanic group, despite competitors only being discharged when no longer symptomatic. Oral readings at discharge were significantly lower than tympanic readings (33.8 degrees C [95\% CI, 33.2 degrees C to 34.5 degrees C] vs 35.0 degrees C [95\% CI, 34.6 degrees C to 35.3 degrees C], respectively, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: The use of thermometers had a limited role in discharging competitors at this event, who were apparently safely discharged when no longer symptomatic. Treating clinicians and the thermometers did not always agree on whether a patient was hypothermic or not. Oral and tympanic thermometers had poor agreement. Routine thermometer readings at future events may be unnecessary, although screening competitors of concern will remain useful.},

Traditionally, EEG signals are recorded by positioning electrodes on the scalp and keeping them in place with glue, rubber bands, or elastic caps. This setup provides good coverage of the head, but is impractical for EEG acquisition in natural daily-life situations. Here, we propose the transparent EEG concept. Transparent EEG aims for motion tolerant, highly portable, unobtrusive, and near invisible data acquisition with minimum disturbance of a user's daily activities. In recent years several ear-centered EEG solutions that are compatible with the transparent EEG concept have been presented. We discuss work showing that miniature electrodes placed in and around the human ear are a feasible solution, as they are sensitive enough to pick up electrical signals stemming from various brain and non-brain sources. We also describe the cEEGrid flex-printed sensor array, which enables unobtrusive multi-channel EEG acquisition from around the ear. In a number of validation studies we found that the cEEGrid enables the recording of meaningful continuous EEG, event-related potentials and neural oscillations. Here, we explain the rationale underlying the cEEGrid ear-EEG solution, present possible use cases and identify open issues that need to be solved on the way toward transparent EEG.},

To enable a continuous unobtrusive monitoring of core body temperature on ambulatory patients and exercising athletes, we have designed a wireless wearable system that measures the tympanic temperature inside the ear, as well as skin and environmental temperature, and that allows remote monitoring of the collected measurements. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the system and show that it can be used to identify the circadian rhythms of core body temperature, as well as to detect the variation in core body temperature due to prolonged physical exertion. We further describe the lessons learnt during a pilot deployment of our telemetric system on several athletes during the 5th L\"ubeck Marathon, and discuss the impact of environmental parameters such as temperature and wind on the accuracy and meaningfulness of the measured values.},

METHODS: After approval by the local Ethics Committee, 26 (six female and 20 male) patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were included in a single center open trial. During surgery, temperature measurements were recorded with the IRT 4000 in the left ear, and with a tympanic contact probe in the right ear, as well as with a PAC as reference. Measurements with the infrared ear thermometers and continual PAC values were recorded every six minutes. RESULTS: The average temperature measured with the IRT 4000 was 0.08 degrees C above the temperature of the PAC (95\% confidence interval from -0.44-0.61 degrees C). CONCLUSION: Infrared ear thermometers 4000 temperature readings accurately reflect body core temperature and correlate well with the invasive PAC. Infrared ear thermometers may present a clinically useful alternative to the pulmonary artery thermometry for the measurement of core temperature in the perioperative setting or in the intensive care unit.},

Objective:~           To compare the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of a thermistor thermometer (thermistor) and two different infrared thermometers (one designed to measure tympanic temperature and one for skin temperature).           Design:~           Reliability and validity were evaluated by making two separate measurements from the skin at identical spots of each hand, forearm, shoulder, thigh, shin, and foot in 17 healthy subjects. Intramuscular temperature was recorded at the hand and shin sites. Test\textendash retest reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation for each instrument. Pearson correlation assessed the relationship between the skin and intramuscular temperatures at the hand and shin sites (validity). Each instrument's ability to measure temperature change (responsiveness) was assessed by measuring skin temperatures serially from 17 limbs of ten patients with complex regional pain syndrome undergoing intravenous regional sympathetic blockade. Responsiveness index values were calculated.           Results:~           Reliability was strong and similar for each device (intraclass correlation: thermistor = 0.96, tympanic = 0.96, skin = 0.97), as was validity (r: thermistor = 0.90, tympanic = 0.92, skin = 0.92). Responsiveness was marginally better for the infrared skin device (responsiveness index: skin = 4.2, tympanic = 3.6, thermistor = 3.6).           Conclusions:~           For the purposes of clinical electrodiagnostic laboratory and other physiatry applications, the performance of the infrared thermometers is equal to or superior to that of the traditionally used thermistor. All three devices are highly reliable and valid, whereas the infrared skin device is slightly more responsive. Infrared thermometers have the advantage of being quicker to operate and more portable.},

  abstract = {We tested the hypotheses that accuracy and precision of available temperature monitoring methods are different between spinal anesthesia (SA) and general anesthesia (GA), and that patients receiving SA are at equal risk for hypothermia as those receiving GA. Patients scheduled for radical retropubic prostatectomy were enrolled. Either GA (n = 16) or SA (n = 16) was given according to patient and clinician preference. Temperatures were monitored with thermocouple probes at the tympanic membrane, axilla, rectum, and forehead skin surface. Tympanic temperatures were also measured with an infrared device, and forehead skin temperatures were monitored with two brands of liquid crystal thermometer strips. Accuracy and precision of these monitoring methods were determined by using tympanic membrane temperature, measured by thermocouple, as the reference core temperature (T(c)). At the end of surgery, T(c) was similar between SA (35.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C) and GA (35.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C) (P = 0.44). Accuracy and precision of each temperature monitoring method were similar between SA and GA. Rectal temperature monitoring offered the greatest combination of accuracy and precision. All other methods underestimated T(c). These findings suggest that patients receiving SA or GA are at equal and significant risk for hypothermia, and should have their temperatures carefully monitored, recognizing that most monitoring methods underestimate T(c). IMPLICATIONS: Body temperature should be monitored during spinal anesthesia because patients are at significant risk for hypothermia. Rectal temperature is a valid method of measuring core temperature, whereas other methods tend to underestimate true core temperature.},

The proposed behind-the-ear device makes the system desirable to measure ECG data: technically less complex, physically attached to non-hair regions, hence more suitable for long term use, and user friendly as no need to undress the top garment. The proposed smart sensor device is similar to the hearing aid device and is wirelessly connected to a smartphone for physiological data transmission and displaying. This device not only gives access to the core temperature and ECG from the ear, but also the device can be controlled (removed and reapplied) by the patient at any time, thus increasing the usability of personal healthcare applications. A number of combination ECG electrodes, which are based on the area of the electrode and dry/non-dry nature of the surface of the electrodes are tested at various locations near behind the ear. The best ECG electrode is then chosen based on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the measured ECG signals. These electrodes showed acceptable SNR ratio of \textasciitilde 20 db, which is comparable with existing tradition ECG electrodes. The developed ECG electrode systems is then integrated with commercially available PPG sensor (Amperor pulse oximeter) and core body temperature sensor (MLX90614) using a specialized micro controller (Arduino UNO) and the results monitored using a newly developed smartphone (android) application.},

In this study, graphene inks were utilized to increase the accuracy of the temperature measurements from the ear by coating graphene platelets on the lens of an infrared thermopile sensor.

Raw data are continuously and wirelessly plotted on a mobile phone app. The test was performed on 10 subjects under resting and exercising in a total period of 25 min. Achieved results were compared with the commercially available Braun Thermoscan, Original Thermopile, and Cosinuss One ear thermometers.

  abstract = {Female reproductive hormones exert important non-reproductive influences on autonomic regulation of body temperature and blood pressure. Estradiol and progesterone influence thermoregulation both centrally and peripherally, where estradiol tends to promote heat dissipation, and progesterone tends to promote heat conservation and higher body temperatures. Changes in thermoregulation over the course of the menstrual cycle and with hot flashes at menopause are mediated by hormonal influences on neural control of skin blood flow and sweating. The influence of estradiol is to promote vasodilation, which, in the skin, results in greater heat dissipation. In the context of blood pressure regulation, both central and peripheral hormonal influences are important as well. Peripherally, the vasodilator influence of estradiol contributes to the lower blood pressures and smaller risk of hypertension seen in young women compared to young men. This is in part due to a mechanism by which estradiol augments beta-adrenergic receptor mediated vasodilation, offsetting alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction, and resulting in a weak relationship between muscle sympathetic nerve activity and total peripheral resistance, and between muscle sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure. After menopause, with the loss of reproductive hormones, sympathetic nerve activity, peripheral resistance and blood pressure become more strongly related, and sympathetic nerve activity (which increases with age) becomes a more important contributor to the prevailing level of blood pressure. Continuing to increase our understanding of sex hormone influences on body temperature and blood pressure regulation will provide important insight for optimization of individualized health care for future generations of women.},

  abstract = {Many types of thermometers have been developed to measure body temperature. Infrared thermometers (IRT) are fast, convenient and ease to use. Two types of infrared thermometers are uses to measure body temperature: tympanic and forehead. With the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus, forehead temperature measurement is used widely to screen people for the illness. The performance of this type of device and the criteria for screening are worth studying. This study evaluated the performance of two types of tympanic infrared thermometers and an industrial infrared thermometer. The results showed that these infrared thermometers provide good precision. A fixed offset between tympanic and forehead temperature were found. The measurement values for wrist temperature show significant offsets with the tympanic temperature and cannot be used to screen fevers. The standard operating procedure (SOP) for the measurement of body temperature using an infrared thermometer was proposed. The suggestion threshold for the forehead temperature is 36 \textdegree C for screening of fever. The body temperature of a person who is possibly ill is then measured using a tympanic infrared thermometer for the purpose of a double check.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveIn this randomized controlled study, we aimed to determine whether non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) are more time-efficient and create less patient distress than mercury axillary thermometers (MATs) and infrared tympanic thermometers (ITTs).MethodsForty-five rehabilitation inpatients were randomly assigned to one of three groups (NCIT, MAT, and ITT). Time required to measure body temperature with an NCIT, MAT, and ITT was recorded. We examined associations between time required to take patients? temperature and measuring device used. Patient distress experienced during temperature measurement using the three thermometers was recorded.ResultsA significantly longer average time was required to measure temperatures using the MAT (mean 43.17, standard deviation [SD] 8.39) than the ITT (mean 13.74, SD 1.63) and NCIT (mean 12.13, SD 1.18). The thermometer used influenced the time required to measure body temperature (t?=?33.99). There were significant differences among groups (NCIT vs. ITT, NCIT vs. MAT, and ITT vs. MAT) regarding patient distress among the different thermometers. Most distress arose owing to needing help from others, sleep disruption, and boredom.ConclusionThe NCIT has clinically relevant advantages over the ITT and MAT in measuring body temperature among rehabilitation patients, including saving nurses? time and avoiding unnecessary patient distress.Clinical trial registration number (http://www.chictr.org.cn): ChiCTR1800019756.},

  abstract = {Background\textemdash Ear thermometers are becoming popular as a method for measuring deep body (core) temperature. Aim\textemdash To determine the variability of a single user's tympanic membrane (ear) temperature measurements. Subjects\textemdash Forty two, afebrile, healthy children, and 20 febrile children with acute burns. Results\textemdash In afebrile children measurements made in both ears (and within just a few minutes of each other) diVered by as much as 0.6\textdegree C. Operator measurement error, sw of three consecutive measurements, in the same ear, was 0.13\textdegree C. In the group of febrile, burned children, core temperature was measured hourly at a number of sites (ear, rectum, axilla, bladder). A peak in core temperature occurred approximately 10\textendash 12 hours after the burn. Measurement error was calculated in 14 febrile, burned children with a peak temperature in excess of 38\textdegree C. For the left ear, measurement error was 0.19\textdegree C and for the right ear, 0.11\textdegree C. In the febrile children agreement between the ears was poor. The limits of agreement were 0.4\textdegree C to -0.8\textdegree C. It was not possible to predict the occasions when the temperature diVerences between the ears would be large or small. Conclusions\textemdash The measurement error of one recording from the next is probably acceptable at about 0.1 to 0.2\textdegree C. To limit the variations in temperature of one ear to the other, measurements should be restricted to one of the ears whenever possible and the same ear used throughout the temperature monitoring period. Nurses and parents should take more than one temperature reading from the same ear whenever possible.},

Design A systematic review of studies comparing temperature measured at the axilla (test site) with temperature measured at the rectum (reference site) using the same type of measuring device at both sites in each patient. Devices were mercury or electronic thermometers or indwelling thermocouple probes. Studies reviewed 40 studies including 5528 children and young people from birth to 18 years. Data extraction Difference in temperature readings at the axilla and rectum. Results 20 studies (n=3201 (58\%) participants) had sufficient data to be included in a meta-analysis. There was significant residual heterogeneity in both mean differences and sample standard deviations within the groups using different devices and within age groups. The pooled (random effects) mean temperature difference (rectal minus axillary temperature) for mercury thermometers was 0.25\textdegree C (95\% limits of agreement -0.15\textdegree C to 0.65\textdegree C) and for electronic thermometers was 0.85\textdegree C (-0.19\textdegree C to 1.90\textdegree C).

Conclusions The difference between temperature readings at the axilla and rectum using either mercury or electronic thermometers showed wide variation across studies.

However, those observations were based on studies of humans exposed to light levels sufficient to confound circadian period estimation. Precise estimation of the periods of the endogenous circadian rhythms of melatonin, core body temperature, and cortisol in healthy young and older individuals living in carefully controlled lighting conditions has now revealed that the intrinsic period of the human circadian pacemaker averages 24.18 hours in both age groups, with a tight distribution consistent with other species.

Stress affects an organism's welfare status and induces energy-consuming mechanisms to combat the subsequent ill effects; thus, the individual may be immunocompromised, making them vulnerable to pathogens. The information presented here has been extensively reviewed, compiled, and analyzed from authenticated published resources available on Medline, PubMed, PubMed Central, Science Direct, and other scientific databases. Stress levels can be monitored by the quantitative and qualitative measurement of biomarkers. Potential markers of stress include thermal stress markers, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), innate immune markers, such as Acute Phase Proteins (APPs), oxidative stress markers, and chemical secretions in the saliva and urine. In addition, stress biomarkers also play critical roles in the prognosis of stress-related diseases and disorders, and therapy guidance. Moreover, different components have been identified as potent mediators of cardiovascular, central nervous system, hepatic, and nephrological disorders, which can also be employed to evaluate these conditions precisely, but with stringent validation and specificity. Considerable scientific advances have been made in the detection, quantitation, and application of these biomarkers. The present review describes the current progress of identifying biomarkers, their prognostic, and therapeutic values.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives To investigate sensitivity and specificity of infrared ear thermometry compared to rectal thermometry to detect fever in children. Methods Systematic review of studies comparing rectal and infrared ear temperatures in children. Results Sensitivity and specificity estimates were highly heterogeneous, and displayed an inverse relationship suggestive of a threshold effect, due in part to the different offsets used to obtain adjusted tympanic temperatures depending on the ear thermometer mode. To account for this threshold effect, results from each study were summarized as a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). These varied extensively across studies, suggesting that heterogeneity between study estimates is not fully explained by the threshold effect. Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity from random effects models were 63.7\% (95\% CI 55.6\%, 71.8\%) and 95.2\% (95\% CI 93.5\%, 96.9\%), respectively. Conclusion Pooled estimates of measures of diagnostic accuracy from these studies suggest that infrared ear thermometry would fail to diagnose fever in three or four out of every 10 febrile children (with fever defined by a rectal temperature of 38\textdegree C or above). These findings support our previous concerns about the use of infrared ear thermometers in situations where a failure to detect fever has serious implications.},

  abstract = {Heat-related illnesses, which range from heat exhaustion to heatstroke, affect thousands of individuals worldwide every year and are characterized by extreme hyperthermia with the core body temperature (CBT) usually {$>$} 40 \textdegree C, decline in physical and athletic performance, CNS dysfunction, and, eventually, multiorgan failure. The measurement of CBT has been shown to predict heat-related illness and its severity, but the current measurement methods are not practical for use in high acuity and high motion settings due to their invasive and obstructive nature or excessive costs. Noninvasive predictions of CBT using wearable technology and predictive algorithms offer the potential for continuous CBT monitoring and early intervention to prevent HRI in athletic, military, and intense work environments. Thus far, there has been a lack of peer-reviewed literature assessing the efficacy of wearable devices and predictive analytics to predict CBT to mitigate heat-related illness. This systematic review identified 20 studies representing a total of 25 distinct algorithms to predict the core body temperature using wearable technology. While a high accuracy in prediction was noted, with 17 out of 18 algorithms meeting the clinical validity standards. few algorithms incorporated individual and environmental data into their core body temperature prediction algorithms, despite the known impact of individual health and situational and environmental factors on CBT. Robust machine learning methods offer the ability to develop more accurate, reliable, and personalized CBT prediction algorithms using wearable devices by including additional data on user characteristics, workout intensity, and the surrounding environment. The integration and interoperability of CBT prediction algorithms with existing heat-related illness prevention and treatment tools, including heat indices such as the WBGT, athlete management systems, and electronic medical records, will further prevent HRI and increase the availability and speed of data access during critical heat events, improving the clinical decision-making process for athletic trainers and physicians, sports scientists, employers, and military officers.},

We explore in-ear PPG inaccuracies stemming from different sensor placements and motion-induced artifacts.

  abstract = {The accuracy of core temperature (Tc) thermometry from temporal, tympanic, and oral thermometry devices has been variable during exercise in a hot, humid environment. The purpose of the present study was to cross-validate temporal, two tympanic devices, and oral devices compared to an ingestible thermistor during exercise in a hot, humid environment. Fourteen young, active adults (6 women) completed a graded exercise test until voluntary exhaustion in an environmental chamber (35.5 {$\pm$} 0.6 \textdegree C, 53.9 {$\pm$} 5.8 \% RH). There was no statistical difference in mean temperature between tympanic device 1 and pill-based core temperature (PBTc) measurements across all time points and were positively correlated (0.357; P{$<$}0.001). Temperatures of tympanic device 2 were statistically higher than PBTc (37.8 {$\pm$} 0.7 \textordmasculine C vs. 37.6 {$\pm$} 1.0 \textordmasculine C; respectfully) (P=0.008). At all time points, temperatures for the second tympanic device and PBTc were positively correlated (0.192; P=0.043). Temporal and PBTc values did not differ across time points and were positively correlated (0.262; P=0.005) across all time points. Mean oral temperature was significantly less than mean PBTc across all time points. (37.0 {$\pm$} 0.4 \textordmasculine C vs. 37.6 {$\pm$} 1.0 \textordmasculine C, respectively) (P{$<$}0.001). Across all time points, oral and PBTc were positively correlated (0.262; P=0.010). Tympanic and temporal devices can reflect Tc while exercising in a hot, humid environment. However, care should be taken when selecting the tympanic or temporal measurement device and validation is advised prior to heat illness mitigation in the field.},

  abstract = {This research study was undertaken to examine the relationship between pulmonary artery blood temperature (regarded as the `gold standard' measurement for core body temperature), axilla temperature using the Tempa.DOT Ax chemical thermometer and tympanic membrane temperature using the Diatek 9000 Insta Temp thermometer. Sixty adult intensive care patients had their temperatures monitored. A single set of five simultaneous temperatures, i.e. left and right axilla, left and right tympanic membrane (TM), and pulmonary artery (PA) blood were recorded. The mean difference between left and right TM temperatures was 0.58\textdegree C, and although both were moderately well correlated with PA temperature (r = 0.63 and 0.78, respectively) the mean differences between the two sites were clinically significant (0.85\textdegree C and 0.94\textdegree C, respectively). The range of differences between the sites was significant. Plotting limits of agreement showed that both left and right TM temperatures may be up to 1.2\textdegree C above or 1.3\textdegree C below PA blood temperature: a clinically unacceptable range. In particular, large temperature differences were recorded when patients were lying with one side of their head to a pillow. Fan therapy directed to the head was not found to affect these differences significantly. The mean difference between left and right axilla temperatures was 0.36\textdegree C, and although both were modestly correlated with PA temperature (r = 0.48 and 0.53, respectively) the mean differences between the two sites were clinically significant (0.47\textdegree C and 0.50\textdegree C, respectively). The range of differences between the sites was particularly significant. Plotting limits of agreement showed that both left and right axilla temperatures may be up to 1.2\textdegree C above or 1.6\textdegree C below PA blood temperature: a clinically unacceptable range. Because the range of temperature differences found between PA blood and the other sites was so great, it is concluded that neither the chemical axilla thermometer nor the tympanic membrane thermometer used in this study are clinically reliable tools for adult intensive care patients.},

  abstract = {Context: When assessing exercise hyperthermia outdoors, the validity of certain commonly used body temperature measuring devices has been questioned. A controlled laboratory environment is generally less influenced by environmental factors (eg, ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind) than an outdoor setting. The validity of these temperature measuring devices in a controlled environment may be more acceptable. Objective: To assess the validity and reliability of commonly used temperature devices compared with rectal temperature in individuals exercising in a controlled, high environmental temperature indoor setting and then resting in a cool environment. Design: Time series study. Setting: Laboratory environmental chamber (temperature {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 36.4 {$\pm$} 1.2\textdegree C [97.5 {$\pm$} 2.16\textdegree F], relative humidity {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 52\%) and cool laboratory (temperature {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} approximately 23.3\textdegree C [74.0\textdegree F], relative humidity {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 40\%). Patients or Other Participants: Fifteen males and 10 females. Intervention(s): Rectal, gastrointestinal, forehead, oral, aural, temporal, and axillary temperatures were measured with commonly used temperature devices. Temperature was measured before and 20 minutes after entering the environmental chamber, every 30 minutes during a 90-minute treadmill walk in the heat, and every 20 minutes during a 60-minute rest in mild conditions. Device validity and reliability were assessed with various statistical measures to compare the measurements using each device with rectal temperature. A device was considered invalid if the mean bias (average difference between rectal and device temperatures) was more than {$\pm$}0.27\textdegree C ({$\pm$}0.50\textdegree F). Main Outcome Measure(s): Measured temperature from each device (mean and across time). Results:  The following devices provided invalid estimates of rectal temperature: forehead sticker (0.29\textdegree C [0.52\textdegree F]), oral temperature using an inexpensive device (-1.13\textdegree C [-2.03\textdegree F]), temporal temperature measured according to the instruction manual (-0.87\textdegree C [-1.56\textdegree F]), temporal temperature using a modified technique (-0.63\textdegree C [-1.13\textdegree F]), oral temperature using an expensive device (-0.86\textdegree C, [-1.55\textdegree F]), aural temperature (-0.67\textdegree C, [-1.20\textdegree F]), axillary temperature using an inexpensive device (-1.25\textdegree C, [-2.24\textdegree F]), and axillary temperature using an expensive device (-0.94\textdegree F [-1.70\textdegree F]). Measurement of intestinal temperature (mean bias of -0.02\textdegree C [-0.03\textdegree F]) was the only device considered valid. Devices measured in succession (intestinal, forehead, temporal, and aural) showed acceptable reliability (all had a mean bias {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 0.09\textdegree C [0.16\textdegree F] and r {$\geq$} 0.94]). Conclusions: Even during laboratory exercise in a controlled environment, devices used to measure forehead, temporal, oral, aural, and axillary body sites did not provide valid estimates of rectal temperature. Only intestinal temperature measurement met the criterion. Therefore, we recommend that rectal or intestinal temperature be used to assess hyperthermia in individuals exercising indoors in the heat.},

  abstract = {Monitoring a person's dietary behavior has many health applications (e.g. weight management). Existing approaches for automatic eating detection using wearable sensors often require custom hardware that may not be practical as their usability and energy efficiency have not been validated. In this paper, we propose to use off-the-shelf Bluetooth headsets to unobtrusively monitor and detect users' eating episodes by analyzing the chewing sound. The challenges of using commodity acoustic hardware include the limited sampling rate that reduces feature fidelity and the impact of environment noise in real-world settings. Our experimental results show that the traditional kernel-based approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) could achieve 94-95\% classification accuracy in lab settings, though the detection performance quickly degraded to 65-76\% for in-the-field testing. We then propose a novel Deep Learning based classification technique that drastically improved detection accuracy to 77-94\% despite the existence of ambient noise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use Bluetooth headsets to detect eating episodes and to use Deep Learning to significantly increase classification performance in this context. We believe that the adoption of readily available and low-cost consumer devices provides a foundation for practical deployment of automated dietary monitoring applications.},

  abstract = {Background During investigation and diagnosis of patients, accurate temperature measurement is of great importance. The advantages of tympanic membrane thermometry are speed (temperature reading available within seconds), safety, and ease of use. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of infrared tympanic thermometers in comparison to mercury thermometers in measurement of body temperature. Methods Axillary and tympanic temperature was measured simultaneously in consecutive patients using mercury glass and infrared tympanic thermometers at Omdurman Hospital, Sudan during October 2012. Results In total, temperature was measured in 174 patients, 95 of whom (54.6\%) were male. The mean (SD) patient age and weight was 33.18 (25.07) years and 52.13 (69.85) kg. There was no significant difference in mean (SD) temperature measurement between mercury and infrared tympanic membrane thermometers, 37.29\textdegree C (0.91) versus 37.38\textdegree C (0.95), P\,=\,0.373, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between axillary and tympanic body temperature measurements (r\,=\,0.697, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). The mean difference between the two readings (with limits of agreements) was - 0.093 (-0.20; 0.02) \textdegree C. Conclusion In this study, tympanic membrane thermometry is as reliable and accurate as axillary mercury glass thermometry. Thus, tympanic thermometry can be used in clinical practice, especially in the emergency setting, where ease of use and speed of obtaining the temperature reading are important.},

The feasibility and accuracy of the data generated by these devices so as to replace the standard medical methods in use today is still under scrutiny. In this paper, we present an ear-worn device to measure cardiovascular and sweat parameters during physical exercise. ECG bipolar recordings capture the electric potential around both ears, whereas sweat rate is estimated by the impedance method over one segment of tissue closer to the left ear, complemented by the measurement of the lactate and pH levels using amperiometric and potentiometric sensors, respectively. Together with head acceleration, the acquired data is sent to a mobile phone via BLE, enabling extended periods of signal recording. Results obtained by the device have shown a SNR level of 18 dB for the ECG signal recorded around the ears, a THD value of -20.46 dB for the excitation signal involved in impedance measurements, sweat conductivity of 0.08 S/m at 1 kHz and sensitivities of 50 mV/pH and 0.8 {$\mu$}A/mM for the pH and lactate acquisition channels, respectively. Testing of the device was performed in human subjects during indoors cycling with characteristic level changes.},

We evaluated the use of continuous body temperature monitoring with a vaginal biosensor to improve standard diagnostic procedures for determining ovulatory dysfunction. Material and Methods This prospective interventional study was performed in a reproductive medicine department of a university hospital. The menstrual cycles of 51 women with infertility were monitored and analysed using three different strategies: sonographic and hormonal assessment (standard approach), continuous core body temperature measurement and analysis using the algorithm of OvulaRing, and lowest daily body temperature measurement monitored with a vaginal biosensor and analysed based on the body temperature curves used in natural family planning. Results Statistically significant differences were found in the temperature curves of women with luteal phase deficiency and polycystic ovary syndrome compared to women with normal menstrual cycles. The analysis of individual cyclofertilograms can be used to detect cycle phases and estimate the date of ovulation. Conclusions Continuous body temperature monitoring with a vaginal biosensor can improve the standard diagnostic procedures used to determine ovulatory dysfunction, especially if dysfunction is due to luteal phase deficiency and polycystic ovary syndrome. Analysis of the lowest daily body temperature combined with the basal body temperature measurements used in fertility awareness methods may be equieffective to continuous body temperature measurements with OvulaRing. The results of this study show that a revised diagnostic approach using fewer hormonal assessments combined with continuous body temperature monitoring can reduce the number of appointments in an infertility clinic as well as the costs.},

  abstract = {Human aging is associated with an augmented pressor response to cold stress; however, whether this is due to alterations in sympathetic nervous system activation remains unclear. We hypothesized that whole-body cold stress elicits greater sympathetic nervous system responses in older (O) compared to young (Y) adults. Reflex vasoconstriction was induced in 7 Y (24{$\pm$}1 yr) and 6 O adults (66{$\pm$}2 yr) by lowering mean skin temperature (Tsk) from 34 to 30.5\textcelsius{} using a water-perfused suit. BP, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; peroneal microneurography), and red blood cell flux (laser Doppler flowmetry; dorsum of foot) were measured continuously. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC=flux/mean BP) was expressed as a percent change from baseline. The increase in systolic BP during whole-body cold stress was greater in O adults ({$\increment$}2{$\pm$}1 Y v. {$\increment$}10{$\pm$}2 O mmHg; P{$<$}0.05); however, the increase in mean BP was not different ({$\increment$}5{$\pm$}1 Y v. {$\increment$}6{$\pm$}1 O mmHg; P{$>$}0.05). Reflex cutaneous vasoconstriction was attenuated in O adults (-31{$\pm$}6 Y v. -14{$\pm$}3 O \%{$\increment$}CVC; P{$<$}0.05). MSNA was greater in O adults at baseline (Tsk=34\textcelsius; 14{$\pm$}3 Y v. 25{$\pm$}2 O burst/min) and during cooling (Tsk=30.5\textcelsius; 14{$\pm$}4 Y v. 37{$\pm$}3 O burst/min; both P{$<$}0.05). MSNA increased during cooling in O, but not Y, adults ({$\increment$}-1{$\pm$}1 Y v. {$\increment$}12{$\pm$}3 O burst/min; P{$<$}0.05). These data suggest the MSNA response to cold stress is augmented, but peripheral vascular response is attenuated, in healthy aging.

  abstract = {Objective: The question addressed here is: Can a discrete sleep disordered breathing (SDB) play a role in the insomnia complaint of postmenopausal chronic insomniacs? To respond to the query, two groups of individuals derived from a cohort of postmenopausal chronic insomniacs recruited mostly from the community were enlisted in a treatment protocol. These subjects were all individuals identified with normal breathing (n=68) and all those recognized with Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS) (n=62) pooled from a cohort of 349 postmenopausal insomniacs. Treatment protocol: The 62 UARS were allocated to either treatment of chronic insomnia by behavioral approaches or treatment of SDB. Based on ENT evaluation, health professionals in charge of patients selected either treatment with nasal CPAP or treatment of nasal turbinates. A stratification correction was performed to obtain a near equal number of both treatment modalities in each of the two subgroups. The 68 individuals with normal breathing were randomly allocated to immediate behavioral treatment of insomnia or delay treatment of insomnia. The delay treatment received a list of 10 sleep hygiene recommendations by mail. Methodology: Questionnaires, visual analog scales (VAS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), clinical interviews, clinical evaluation with oto-laryngologic clinical assessment of a presence/absence of narrow upper airway and location of narrowing. Actigraphy and polysomnography (PSG) with pressure transducer/and nasal cannula system and esophageal manometry. Data analyses: All recording data were scored blind to patient's condition. Results: Two subjects in the SBD-CPAP treated group (Group B) and two subjects in the delayed treatment group (Group D) dropped out. Total sleep time was improved compared to baseline in all groups, including the delayed treatment group. One group was significantly better (ANOVA, P=.05) with a more important {$\delta$} score compared to baseline, and this was the behaviorally treated non-SDB. Sleep latency was significantly decreased in the behaviorally treated group (with or without SBD), P=.05, compared to SBD-treated and delayed treatment groups. Sleep latency was, however, improved in all groups. VAS for ``quality of sleep'' was higher at 6 months in all the groups when compared to ``baseline'' values. VAS for ``daytime fatigue'' showed significant differences among the four groups (ANOVA, P=.01); the overall score at the end of treatment was significantly better in the SDB-treated group than the other three groups. SBD was treated either by radio frequency on nasal turbinate or by nasal CPAP. CPAP-treated patients had a lower VAS score than nasal turbinate treatment, but the difference was only a trend. The {$\delta$} improvement (6-month baseline condition) in ``daytime fatigue'' of each subgroup was calculated and compared within and between groups. Despite the small number of subjects, the turbinate-treated subgroup was significantly different from Groups B, C and D (ANOVA, P=.05). When a similar comparison was made with the nasal CPAP group, there was only a nonsignificant trend when compared to Groups B, C and D. Conclusion: Abnormal breathing during sleep significantly enhanced complaints of daytime fatigue in postmenopausal chronic insomniacs and this complaint improved with SDB treatment. This improvement is significantly better compared to SDB insomniacs treated with a behavioral regimen. Behavioral treatment, however, gave the best response in the non-SDB chronic insomnia group and improved better long sleep latency even in the SDB group. These results suggest the need to find an appropriate treatment for SBD even if mild and to recognize the role of SDB in relation to symptoms seen with chronic insomnia.},

  abstract = {Mammals have evolved a range of behavioural and neurological mechanisms that coordinate cycles of thermoregulation and sleep. Whether diurnal or nocturnal, sleep onset and a reduction in core temperature occur together. Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep episodes are also accompanied by core and brain cooling. Thermoregulatory behaviours, like nest building and curling up, accompany this circadian temperature decline in preparation for sleeping. This could be a matter of simply comfort as animals seek warmth to compensate for lower temperatures. However, in both humans and other mammals, direct skin warming can shorten sleep-latency and promote NREM sleep. We discuss the evidence that body cooling and sleep are more fundamentally connected and that thermoregulatory behaviours, prior to sleep, form warm microclimates that accelerate NREM directly through neuronal circuits. Paradoxically, this warmth might also induce vasodilation and body cooling. In this way, warmth seeking and nesting behaviour might enhance the circadian cycle by activating specific circuits that link NREM initiation to body cooling. We suggest that these circuits explain why NREM onset is most likely when core temperature is at its steepest rate of decline and why transitions to NREM are accompanied by a decrease in brain temperature. This connection may have implications for energy homeostasis and the function of sleep.},

The market for wearable devices that measure the heart rate has grown exponentially, as well as their potential use for healthcare and wellbeing applications. Still, there is a lack of validation of these devices. In particular, this work aims to validate the Apple Watch in terms of HRV derived from the RR interval series provided by the device, both in temporal (HRM (mean heart rate), SDNN, RMSSD and pNN50) and frequency (low and high frequency powers, LF and HF) domain. For this purpose, a database of 20 healthy volunteers subjected to relax and a mild cognitive stress was used. First, RR interval series provided by Apple Watch were validated using as reference the RR interval series provided by a Polar H7 using Bland-Altman plots and reliability and agreement coefficients. Then, HRV parameters derived from both RR interval series were compared and their ability to identify autonomic nervous system (ANS) response to mild cognitive stress was studied. Apple Watch measurements presented very good reliability and agreement ({$>$}0.9). RR interval series provided by Apple Watch contain gaps due to missing RR interval values (on average, 5 gaps per recording, lasting 6.5 s per gap). Temporal HRV indices were not significantly affected by the gaps. However, they produced a significant decrease in the LF and HF power. Despite these differences, HRV indices derived from the Apple Watch RR interval series were able to reflect changes induced by a mild mental stress, showing a significant decrease of HF power as well as RMSSD in stress with respect to relax, suggesting the potential use of HRV measurements derived from Apple Watch for stress monitoring.},

The oral thermometer identified all 28 febrile patients (rectal temperature {$>$} or = 100.4 degrees F). However, the tympanic thermometer detected fever in only 19 of these cases. Two patients in whom the tympanic thermometer failed to detect fever had AIDS, and their workup was altered by the detection of the fever.

  abstract = {The acute stress response can be considered the primary evolutionary adaptation to maximise fitness in the face of unpredictable environmental challenges. However, the difficulties of assessing physiology in natural environments mean comparatively little is known about how response variation influences fitness in free-living animals. Currently, determining acute stress physiology typically involves blood sampling or cardiac monitoring. Both require trapping and handling, interrupting natural behaviour, and potentially biasing our understanding toward trappable species/individuals. Importantly, limits on repeated sampling also restrict response phenotype characterisation, vital for linking stress with fitness. Surface temperature dynamics resulting from peripheral vasomotor activity during acute stress are increasingly promoted as alternative physiological stress indicators, which can be measured non-invasively using infrared thermal imaging, overcoming many limitations of current methods. Nonetheless, which aspects of stress physiology they represent remains unclear, as the underlying mechanisms are unknown. To date, validations have primarily targeted the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, when the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) system is likely the primary driver of vasomotor activity during acute stress. To address this deficit, we compared eye and bill region surface temperatures \textendash{} measured using thermal imaging \textendash{} with SAM system activity \textendash{} measured as heart-rate-variability via electrocardiogram telemetry \textendash{} in wild-caught captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus), during capture and handling. We found lower body surface temperatures were associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activation. Consequently, our data confirm body surface temperatures can act as a proxy for sympathetic activation during acute stress, providing potentially transformative opportunities for linking the acute stress response with fitness in the wild.},

Cerebrospinal fluid A{$\beta$}42 levels were used to determine whether amyloid deposition was present or absent. Sleep parameters were assessed with regard to amyloid deposition. Results Amyloid deposition was associated with worse sleep quality, specifically worse sleep efficiency (\% time in bed that was spent asleep), compared to those without amyloid deposition. In contrast, quantity of sleep was not different between groups, as measured by total sleep time. Frequent napping was associated with amyloid deposition. Interpretation Amyloid deposition in the preclinical stage of AD appears to be associated with worse sleep quality, but not with changes in sleep quantity.},

Therefore, we evaluated a cooling cap for the surface of head and cervical regions in awake volunteers. METHODS: 10 healthy volunteers were treated by external cooling for 190 min using a gel-based cooling device. Vital signs, rectal temperature, tympanic temperature, the extent of shivering and individual perception of frostiness and discomfort were measured. RESULTS: All participants (median age 35 years) successfully completed the treatment and experienced only mild to moderate discomfort. No serious adverse events and no shivering were noticed. There was a significant drop in the tympanic temperature to 34.68\textdegree C (difference from baseline: 1.7\textdegree C, 95\% CI: 0.61-2.7\textdegree C, p = 0.001), in the rectal temperature to 36.65\textdegree C (difference from baseline: 0.65\textdegree C, 95\% CI: 0.06-1.2\textdegree C, p = 0.019) and in the heart rate (difference from baseline: 15 beats/min, 95\% CI: 0.63-30 beats/min, p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Treatment with the cooling device was well tolerated by all participants. The technique had measurable effects on core body temperature (rectal) and tympanic temperature (may reflect temperature at the external ear and skin rather than intracranial). It can be considered as a simple therapeutic approach to patients with suspected stroke in the prehospital setting.},

Although much is known about sensory-motor stabilising mechanisms associated with the head and neck, less is known about how the postural system attenuates motion between the trunk and neck segments in order to regulate head motion. Therefore the purpose of this study was to determine the role that the neck and the trunk play in stabilising the head at a range of walking speeds. Eight healthy male subjects (age: 23{$\pm$}4~years) performed self-selected slow, preferred, and fast walking speed trials along a 30~m walkway. Four custom-designed wireless triaxial accelerometers were attached to the head, upper trunk, lower trunk, and shank of each subject to measure vertical (VT), anterior-posterior (AP), and mediolateral (ML) accelerations. Acceleration data were examined in each direction using RMS, power spectral, harmonic, and regularity measures. Signal regularity was increased from the lower to upper trunk for all walking speeds and directions with the exception of the slow speed in the AP direction. Evidence from analysis of power spectral and amplitude characteristics of acceleration signals was suggestive that accelerations are also attenuated from the lower to upper trunk by dynamics of the intervening trunk segment. Differences in selected power spectral and amplitude characteristics between the accelerations of the upper trunk and head due to the intervening neck segment were only detected in the AP direction at preferred and fast walking speeds. Overall the findings of the present study suggest that the trunk segment plays a critical role in regulating gait-related oscillations in all directions. Only accelerations in the direction of travel at preferred and fast speeds required additional control from the neck segment in order to enhance head stability during walking.},

Infrared tympanic temperature measurement (TTym) is often used by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to assess the core body temperature of firefighters. The accuracy of TTym in this setting has been called into question. Hypothesis/Problem This study aimed to examine the accuracy of TTym for core body temperature assessment at emergency firefighting events compared with gastrointestinal temperature measurement (TGI) as measured by ingestible thermometers. METHODS: Forty-five (42 male, three female) professional urban firefighters from an Australian fire service completed two 20-minute work periods in a 100\textdegree C ({$\pm$} 5\textdegree C) heat chamber while wearing personal protective clothing (PPC) and breathing apparatus (weighing approximately 22 kg). Measurements were taken immediately before entering, and on exiting, the heat chamber. Tympanic temperature was assessed by an infrared tympanic thermometer and TGI was measured by ingestible sensor and radio receiver. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 37 participants. Participant temperatures were higher on exiting the heat chamber than at baseline (TTym: 35.9\textdegree C (SD=0.7) vs 37.5\textdegree C (SD=0.8); TGI: 37.2\textdegree C (SD=0.4) vs 38.6\textdegree C (SD=0.5)). Tympanic temperature underestimated TGI on average by 1.3\textdegree C (SD=0.5) before entering the chamber and by 1.0\textdegree C (SD=0.8) following the exercise. Using pooled data, the average underestimation was 1.2\textdegree C (SD=0.7). CONCLUSION: Tympanic thermometers cause an unreliable measure of core body temperature for firefighters engaged in fire suppression activities. Accurate and practical measures of core body temperature are required urgently.},

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 192 patients (192 surgery cases) who underwent surgery for COM and whose bilateral tympanic membrane temperature was measured with an infrared tympanic thermometer the day before surgery and at 2, 3, 4, and 6 months after surgery. Patients underwent surgery for COM in 1 ear, the other eardrum was intact. Patients who underwent tympanoplasty, simple mastoidectomy, and canal wall up mastoidectomy, surgeries performed to preserve the ear canal, were included in group A, and patients who underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy, a surgery to remove the ear canal, were included in group B. There were 115 and 77 patients in groups A and B, respectively. The mean temperature on the side with COM measured the day before surgery was 37.09\textdegree C\hspace{0.25em}{$\pm$}\hspace{0.25em}0.325\textdegree C and the mean temperature on the opposite normal side was 37.03\textdegree C\hspace{0.25em}{$\pm$}\hspace{0.25em}0.330\textdegree C (P\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}.000). In group A, the eardrum temperature on the surgical and contralateral side was not statistically different after surgery (P\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}.439). The temperature difference between both sides of the eardrums (dTemp) changed from 0.056\textdegree C before surgery to 0.014\textdegree C after surgery (P\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}.008). However, in group B, which canal wall down mastoidectomy was performed, the eardrum temperature of the surgical side was higher than that on the other side (P\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}.001). The dTemp increased up to 0.15\textdegree C after surgery (P\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}.000). The temperature of the eardrum was slightly increased by COM. The COM surgeries, which preserve the ear canal, brought the temperature of the eardrum close to that of the normal eardrum, and the surgery to remove the ear canal raised the temperature of the eardrum.},

However, even in the absence of OSA, disrupted clocks can exacerbate OSA-associated outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular or cognitive outcomes). As we expand our understanding of circadian biology in the setting of OSA, this information could play a significant role in the diagnosis and treatment of OSA.

  abstract = {Aim of the study Therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest improves neurologic outcome. The temperature measured in the pulmonary artery is considered to best reflect core temperature, yet is limited by invasiveness. Recently a femoro-arterial thermodilution catheter (PiCCO-Pulse Contour Cardiac Output) has been introduced in clinical practice as a safe and accurate haemodynamic monitoring system, which is also able to measure blood temperature. The aim of the study was to investigate, if the temperature measured with the PiCCO catheter reflects pulmonary artery temperature better than other sites during therapeutic hypothermia. Methods In this observational study twenty patients after cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation were cooled with various cooling methods to 33{$\pm$}1\textdegree C for 24h, followed by rewarming. Temperatures were recorded continuously in the pulmonary artery (Tpa), femoro-iliacal artery (Tpicco), ear canal (Tear), oesophagus (Toeso) and urinary bladder (Tbla). We assessed agreement of methods using the Bland Altman approach including bias and limits of agreement (LA). Results All other sites differed significantly from Tpa with the bias varying from 0.4\textdegree C (Tbla) to -0.6\textdegree C (Tear). Standard deviations varied from 0.1\textdegree C (Tpicco, Toeso) to 0.5\textdegree C (Tear). For all sites bias was closer to zero with increasing average temperatures. Bias tended to be larger in the cooling phase compared to overall measurements. Conclusions Temperature measurement in the femoro-iliacal artery (Tpicco) reflects the gold standard of pulmonary artery temperature most accurately, especially during the cooling phase. Tpicco is easily accessible and might be used for monitoring core temperature without the need for additional temperature probes.},

  abstract = {The effect of acute stress on working memory (WM) has not been extensively investigated in demanding tasks, although many practitioners, such as pilots, frequently face varying working memory demands. The current study investigated how acute stress modulates pilots' WM performance. Forty-two pilots were randomly assigned to the stress group or the control group. The stress group experienced acute stress induced by the modified Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), whereas the control group did not receive any stress induction. Both groups performed N-back tasks under varying degrees of memory load (0-back, 1-back, and 2-back). State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores, heart rates, and salivary cortisol concentrations were measured in the experiment to determine the extent of induced stress. The results revealed that (1) The modified TSST effectively induced acute stress in the stress group. (2) As rising of memory load, the reaction time expectedly increased while accuracy decreased. (3) An interaction between the stress and control group was found for accuracy, indicating that acute stress might contribute to higher accuracy in moderate WM load (1-back). These suggestions support the emotion regulation hypothesis, in which acute stress induces heightened emotional states that impact WM performance. Furthermore, the current study explored the interplay between acute stress and memory load in a specific population, offering insights into potential pilots' stress management strategies and training programs to improve pilots' WM abilities. These applications would be beneficial for strengthening pilots' coping mechanisms in emergencies and guaranteeing flight safety.},

Objective This study proposes a novel method to characterize sleep-activity rhythms using actigraphy and further use it to describe early childhood daily rhythm formation and examine its association with physical development. Methods We developed a machine learning\textendash based Penalized Multiband Learning (PML) algorithm to sequentially infer dominant periodicities based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm and further characterize daily rhythms. We implemented and applied the algorithm to Actiwatch data collected from a cohort of 262 healthy infants at ages 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, with 159, 101, 111, and 141 participants at each time point, respectively. Autocorrelation analysis and Fisher test in harmonic analysis with Bonferroni correction were applied for comparison with the PML. The association between activity rhythm features and early childhood motor development, assessed using the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-Second Edition (PDMS-2), was studied through linear regression analysis. Results The PML results showed that 1-day periodicity was most dominant at 6 and 12 months, whereas one-day, one-third\textendash day, and half-day periodicities were most dominant at 18 and 24 months. These periodicities were all significant in the Fisher test, with one-fourth\textendash day periodicity also significant at 12 months. Autocorrelation effectively detected 1-day periodicity but not the other periodicities. At 6 months, PDMS-2 was associated with the assessment seasons. At 12 months, PDMS-2 was associated with the assessment seasons and FFT signals at one-third\textendash day periodicity (P{$<$}.001) and half-day periodicity (P=.04), respectively. In particular, the subcategories of stationary, locomotion, and gross motor were associated with the FFT signals at one-third\textendash day periodicity (P{$<$}.001). Conclusions The proposed PML algorithm can effectively conduct circadian rhythm analysis using time-series wearable device data. The application of the method effectively characterized sleep-wake rhythm development and identified the association between daily rhythm formation and motor development during early childhood.},

  abstract = {Background: Wearable sensing and information and communication technologies are key enablers driving the transformation of health care delivery toward a new model of connected health (CH) care. The advances in wearable technologies in the last decade are evidenced in a plethora of original articles, patent documentation, and focused systematic reviews. Although technological innovations continuously respond to emerging challenges and technology availability further supports the evolution of CH solutions, the widespread adoption of wearables remains hindered. Methods: This study followed the scoping review methodology to identify and process the available literature. As the scope surpasses the possibilities of manual search, we relied on the natural language processing tool kit to ensure an efficient and exhaustive search of the literature corpus in three large digital libraries: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, PubMed, and Springer. The search was based on the keywords and properties to be found in articles using the search engines of the digital libraries. Results: The annual number of publications in all segments of research on wearable technology shows an increasing trend from 2010 to February 2019. The technology-related topics dominated in the number of contributions, followed by research on information delivery, safety, and security, whereas user-related concerns were the topic least addressed. The literature corpus evidences milestones in sensor technology (miniaturization and placement), communication architectures and fifth generation (5G) cellular network technology, data analytics, and evolution of cloud and edge computing architectures. The research lag in battery technology makes energy efficiency a relevant consideration in the design of both sensors and network architectures with computational offloading. The most addressed user-related concerns were (technology) acceptance and privacy, whereas research gaps indicate that more efforts should be invested into formalizing clear use cases with timely and valuable feedback and prescriptive recommendations. Conclusions: This study confirms that applications of wearable technology in the CH domain are becoming mature and established as a scientific domain. The current research should bring progress to sustainable delivery of valuable recommendations, enforcement of privacy by design, energy-efficient pervasive sensing, seamless monitoring, and low-latency 5G communications. To complement technology achievements, future work involving all stakeholders providing research evidence on improved care pathways and cost-effectiveness of the CH model is needed.},

The present scoping review was aimed at identifying and synthesizing the available evidence on the use and performance of in-ear monitoring of physiological parameters, with focus on applications in sport science, sport medicine, occupational medicine, and extreme environment settings. Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched to identify studies conducted in the last 10 years and addressing the measurement of three main physiological parameters (temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation) in healthy subjects. Thirty-nine studies were identified, 24 performing temperature measurement, 12 studies on heart/pulse rate, and three studies on oxygen saturation. The collected evidence supports the premise of in-ear sensors as an innovative and unobtrusive way for physiological monitoring during daily-life and physical activity, but further research and technological advancement are necessary to ameliorate measurement accuracy especially in more challenging scenarios.},

For the early detection and prevention of heat-stroke, a wearable health monitor for in-ear use is developed which is subsequently called "Hearable". It aims to measure three vital parameters: Core body temperature, sweat rate and sweat or interstitial sodium ion (Na+) concentration. The eardrum is a good place to measure the core body temperature, because it is close to the carotid artery and the brain. We develop a hearable prototype and it consists of an audio earbud, a sensor earbud and a micro controller. Concerning the sensor earbud, a present prototype includes an eardrum (tympanic) temperature sensor and a sweat rate sensor and we implement two variants. Variant-1 focuses on the sweat rate sensing using a humidity \& temperature sensor located close to the eardrum and Variant-2 focuses on the eardrum temperature sensing using an IR temperature sensor. Concerning the sweat rate sensing, unlike conventional sweat sensors, our prototypes do not include an air flow pump, which is typically used to determine the air flow rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of sweat rate sensing based on the air flow rate measured from the evaporation of defined amount of water. We use Variant-2 to demonstrate the monitoring of the eardrum temperature and the sweat rate to differentiate a calm state and jogging.},

Our developed wearable fine-tuned electric field sensing employs differential amplification to effectively cancel out environmental noise while still being sensitive towards small facial-movement-related electric field changes and artifacts from ear canal deformations. By comparing a mobile with a stationary scenario, we found that EarFS continues to perform better in a mobile scenario. Quantitative results show EarFS to be capable of detecting a set of 5 facial gestures with a precision of 90\% while sitting and 85.2\% while walking. We provide detailed instructions to enable replication of our low-cost sensing device. Applying it to different positions of our body will also allow to sense a variety of other gestures and activities.},

  abstract = {Background. Monitoring temperature in critically ill children is an important component of care, yet the accuracy of methods is often questioned. Temperature measured in the pulmonary artery is considered the `gold standard', but this route is unsuitable for the majority of patients. An accurate, reliable and less invasive method is, however, yet to be established in paediatric intensive care work. Aim. To determine which site most closely reflects core temperature in babies and children following cardiac surgery, by comparing pulmonary artery temperature to the temperature measured at rectal, bladder, nasopharyngeal, axillary and tympanic sites. Method. A convenience sample of 19 postoperative cardiac patients was studied. Interventions. Temperature was recorded as a continuous measurement from pulmonary artery, rectal, nasopharyngeal and bladder sites. Axillary and tympanic temperatures were recorded at 30 minute intervals for 6 1/2 hours postoperatively. Study limitations. The small sample size of 19 infants and children limits the generalizability of the study. Results. Repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated no significant difference between pulmonary artery and bladder temperatures, and pulmonary artery and nasopharyngeal temperatures. Intraclass correlation showed that agreement was greatest between pulmonary artery temperature and temperature measured by bladder catheter. There was a significant difference between pulmonary artery temperature and temperature measured at rectal, tympanic and pulmonary artery and axillary sites. Repeated measures analysis showed a significant lag between pulmonary artery and rectal temperature of between 0 and 150 minutes after the 6-hour measurement period. Conclusions. In this study, bladder temperature was shown to be the best estimate of pulmonary artery temperature, closely followed by the temperature measured by nasopharyngeal probe. The results support the use of bladder or nasopharyngeal catheters to monitor temperature in critically ill children after cardiac surgery.},

  abstract = {Five subjects were sequentially heated and cooled in a double-climate chamber while mean skin temperature (except the head) and head skin temperature were separately varied. The tympanic membrane temperatures of these subjects were disproportionately influenced by changes in head skin temperature. By heating and cooling localized regions of the head, changes in tympanic membrane temperature that followed changes in skin temperature on the ipsilateral side of the head could be produced. During heating of the head, oral and tympanic membrane temperatures were influenced to a similar degree, while esophageal temperature remained essentially unaffected. However, under conditions in which the legs and feet were heated in a water bath, esophageal temperature showed more rapid changes than either tympanic membrane or oral temperature. These findings suggest that tympanic membrane temperature and, to a lesser degree, oral temperature may be affected by thermal exchange occurring between arteries and veins in the cervical and cephalic regions. In addition, the ability to influence selectively esophageal and tympanic membrane temperatures brings into question the arbitrary use of these measurements under widely different experimental conditions as estimates of core temperature.},

  abstract = {The MLX90632 is a non-contact infrared temperature sensor in a small SMD SFN package. The device is factory calibrated with calibration constants stored in the EEPROM memory. The ambient and object temperature can be calculated externally based on these calibration constants and the measurement data. A major strength of the MLX90632 is that these temperature differences around the sensor package will be reduced to a minimum. However, some extreme cases will influence the sensor. The accuracy of the thermometer can be influenced by temperature differences in the package induced by causes like (among others): hot electronics behind the sensor, heaters/coolers behind or beside the sensor or by a hot/cold object very close to the sensor that not only heats the sensing element in the thermometer but also the thermometer package. In the same way, localized thermal variations -like turbulence in the air- will not generate thermal noise in the output signal of the thermopile. The MLX90632 is available in two different versions: standard and medical accuracy. Both versions are calibrated in the ambient temperature range from -20 to 85\r{}C. The difference between both versions is visible in accuracy and the object temperature range. The medical version is factory calibrated with an accuracy of {$\pm$}0.2\r{}C within the narrow object temperature range from 35 to 42\r{}C for medical applications. This version also allows Extended range operation. This measurement type option is implemented in order to give additional range to the medical devices. The object temperature range is limited from -20 to 100\r{}C. For more information see Section 11.2. On the other hand, the standard version covers an object temperature range from -20 to 200\r{}C but offers an accuracy of {$\pm$}1\r{}C. It is very important for the application designer to understand that these accuracies are guaranteed and achievable when the sensor is in thermal equilibrium and under isothermal conditions (no temperature differences across the sensor package). The typical supply voltage of the MLX90632 is 3.3V. For the I2 C communication with the master microcontroller, two versions of the sensor are available, working either at 3.3V or 1.8V I2 C reference voltage. The communication to the chip is done by I 2 C in fast mode plus (FM+). Through I 2 C the external microcontroller has access to the following blocks:  RAM memory used for measurement data, in this document mainly referred to as `storage memory'  EEPROM used to store the trimming values, calibration constants and device/measurement settings Based on this data, the external microcontroller can calculate the object temperature and if needed the sensor temperature. An optical filter (long-wave pass) that cuts off the visible and near infra-red radiant flux is integrated in the sensor to provide ambient light immunity. The wavelength pass band of this optical filter is from 2 till 14\textmu m.},

Responses to stress are influenced by earlier experiences, sex, emotions and cognition, and involve a complex network of neurotransmitters and hormones, that affect multiple biological systems. In addition, the systems activated by stress can be altered by behavioral, metabolic and environmental factors. The impact of stress on metabolic health can thus be considered an emergent process, involving different types of interactions between multiple variables, that are driven by non-linear dynamics at different spatiotemporal scales. To obtain a more comprehensive picture of the links between chronic stress and T2D, we followed a complexity science approach to build a causal loop diagram (CLD) connecting the various mediators and processes involved in stress responses relevant for T2D pathogenesis. This CLD could help develop novel computational models and formulate new hypotheses regarding disease etiology.},

  abstract = {This experiment investigates the validity of six thermometers with different measuring sensors, operation and site of application, to estimate core temperature (Tc) in comparison to an ingestible thermometric sensor based on quartz crystal technology. Measurements were obtained before, during and after exercise in the heat, controlling the presence of air-cooling and skin sweating. Twelve well-trained men swallowed the ingestible thermometer 6~h before the trial. After pre-exercise resting measurements at 20~\textdegree C, subjects entered a heat chamber held at 40~\textdegree C. Exercise in the heat consisted of 60~min of pedalling on cycle ergometer at 90\% of the individually determined first ventilatory threshold. Results reveal that wind and skin sweat invalidate the use of skin infrared thermometry to estimate Tc during exercise in the heat. However, better Tc estimations were obtained in wind-restricted situations. We detected important differences between same-technology devices but different models and brands. In conclusion, there are important limitations to assess Tc accurately using non-invasive thermometers during and after exercise in the heat. Because some devices showed better validity than others did, we recommended using tympanic Braun\textregistered, and non-contact skin infrared Medisana\textregistered{} or Visiofocus\textregistered{} in wind-restricted and no sweat conditions to estimate Tc during exercise in the heat.},

  abstract = {Climatic injuries, including hypothermia, hyperthermia and heat stroke, are common in many sports activities. Body core temperature (Tc) measurement for the sportsperson can influence individual performance and may help to prevent injuries. Monitoring internal body Tc accurately requires invasive methods of measurement. The mercury thermometer, most commonly used to measure oral temperature (Toral), has been almost exclusively the only instrument for measuring Tc since the 18th century. Rectal (Tre) and oesophageal temperatures (Toes) have been the most preferred measurement sites employed in thermoregulatory investigations. However, these measurement sites (Tre, Toes, Toral), and the methods used to measure Tc at these sites, are not convenient. Toral measurements are not always possible or accurate. Toes is undesirable because of the difficulty of inserting the thermistor, irritation to nasal passages and general subject discomfort. Tre is not suitable under many circumstances as it is labour intensive and has a prolonged response time. However, Tre remains the most accurately available method for monitoring Tc in thermal illness that occurs during sports activities. In addition, Tre and Toes require wire connections between the thermistor and the monitoring device. The purpose of this paper is to review the various existing methods of Tc measurements in order to focus on the breakthrough needed for a simple, noninvasive, universally used device for Tc measurement which is essential for preventing climatic injuries during sports events.},

In intensive care clinical practice, the continuous monitoring of core temperature in patients with brain injury is currently highly recommended. After major brain injury, brain temperature is often higher than and can vary independently of systemic temperature. It has been shown that in cases of brain injury, the brain is extremely sensitive and vulnerable to small variations in temperature. The prevention of fever has been proposed as a therapeutic tool to limit neuronal injury. However, temperature control after traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or stroke can be challenging. Furthermore, fever may also have beneficial effects, especially in cases involving infections. While therapeutic hypothermia has shown beneficial effects in animal models, its use is still debated in clinical practice. This paper aims to describe the physiology and pathophysiology of changes in brain temperature after brain injury and to study the effects of controlling brain temperature after such injury.},

Patients were stratified by age, ear canal patency, presence of otitis media, and rectal temperature. Results: Of 224 patients enrolled, 87 (39\%) were febrile. Overall correlation of axillary and tympanic membrane measurements to rectal for all strata was .75 (P = .001) and .81 (P = .001), respectively. Sensitivity in detecting fever for axillary and tympanic membrane sites was .48 and .55, respectively. Otitis media and ear patency did not influence correlation of tympanic membrane measurements.

The purpose of this trial was to determine the reliability of tympanic temperature measurements compared to oral temperature measurements after immersion in water. After ethical approval was obtained, we studied oral and tympanic temperature in 25 volunteer swimmers (aged 18-49 years). Sublingual (Fixotherm; Tradesell Europe, Eglharting, Germany) and tympanic (First Temp Genius; Sherwood Medical, Sulzbach, Germany) temperature measurements were performed before entering the water, after 45 min of immersion in water, and 15 min after leaving the water. During the immersion phase, the ears were temporarily immersed. A control group (the same 25 volunteers) had to swim for the same amount of time without ever immersing their heads in the water. The trial was performed in an indoor swimming pool at 28 degrees C water and 30 degrees C air temperature. The oral temperature did not change over time in either group. The tympanic temperature was significantly lower after immersion compared to baseline in the "immersed" group (33.7 degrees C vs. 37.5 degrees C, p {$<$} 0.001), increased significantly in the recovery period, but remained significantly lower than baseline (36.0 degrees C vs. 37.5 degrees C, p {$<$} 0.001). At baseline, the oral temperature was lower compared to the tympanic temperature. This relationship reversed after immersion and remained reversed until the end of the trial in the immersion group. The control group maintained oral temperatures lower than tympanic throughout the study; furthermore, the control group had no clinically relevant change in oral or tympanic temperature over the time (tympanic temperature: 37.4 degrees C vs. 37.2 degrees C, p = 0.06). Our data suggest that in water-related accidents such as near drowning, the values of body (core) temperature obtained via use of infrared ear thermometry are unreliable, and should not be used for clinical decision-making.},

We also exposed the participants to radiation at 32~\textdegree C. We continuously measured temperatures at the oesophagus, rectum and three different locations along the external auditory canal. We developed equations for estimating oesophageal temperatures from auditory canal temperatures and compared their fitness and errors. The rectal temperature increased or decreased faster than oesophageal temperature at the start or end of exercise in all conditions. Estimated temperature showed good similarity with oesophageal temperature, and the square of the correlation coefficient of the best fitting model reached 0.904. We observed intermediate values between rectal and oesophageal temperatures during the rest phase. Even under the condition with radiation, estimated oesophageal temperature demonstrated concordant movement with oesophageal temperature at around 0.1~\textdegree C overestimation. Our method measured temperatures at three different locations along the external auditory canal. We confirmed that the approach can credibly estimate the oesophageal temperature from 24 to 40~\textdegree C for people performing exercise in the same place in a windless environment.},

We hypothesized that modulation of the peak amplitude and latency of the P300 component in ERP waveforms would differ with task difficulty during passive heat stress and recovery. Subjects performed the Flanker tasks before (Pre), at the end of whole body heating (Heat: internal temperature increase of \textasciitilde 1.2\textdegree C from the pre-heat baseline), and after the internal temperature had returned to the pre-heat baseline (Recovery). The internal temperature was regulated by a tube-lined suit by perfusing 50\textdegree C water for heat stress and 25\textdegree C water for recovery immediately after the heat stress. Regardless of task difficulty, the reaction time (RT) was shortened during Heat rather than Pre and Recovery, and standard deviations of RT (i.e., response variability) were significantly smaller during Heat than Pre. However, the peak amplitudes of the P300 component in ERPs, which involved selective attention, expectancy, and memory updating, were significantly smaller during Heat than during Pre, suggesting the impairment of neural activity in cognitive function. Notably, the peak amplitudes of the P300 component were higher during Recovery than during Heat, indicating that the impaired neural activity had recovered after sufficient whole-body cooling. An indicator of the stimulus classification/evaluation time (peak latency of P300) and the RT were shortened during Heat stress, but such shortening was not noted after whole-body cooling. These results suggest that hyperthermia affects the human cognitive function, reflected by the peak amplitude and latency of the P300 component in ERPs during the Flanker tasks, but sufficient treatment such as whole-body cooling performed in this study can recover those functions.},

  abstract = {The measurement of core body temperature is an efficient method for monitoring heat stress amongst workers in hot conditions. However, invasive measurement of core body temperature (e.g. rectal, intestinal, oesophageal temperature) is impractical for such applications. Therefore, the aim of this study was to define relevant non-invasive measures to predict core body temperature under various conditions. We conducted two human subject studies with different experimental protocols, different environmental temperatures (10~\textdegree C, 30~\textdegree C) and different subjects. In both studies the same non-invasive measurement methods (skin temperature, skin heat flux, heart rate) were applied. A principle component analysis was conducted to extract independent factors, which were then used in a linear regression model. We identified six parameters (three skin temperatures, two skin heat fluxes and heart rate), which were included for the calculation of two factors. The predictive value of these factors for core body temperature was evaluated by a multiple regression analysis. The calculated root mean square deviation (rmsd) was in the range from 0.28~\textdegree C to 0.34~\textdegree C for all environmental conditions. These errors are similar to previous models using non-invasive measures to predict core body temperature. The results from this study illustrate that multiple physiological parameters (e.g. skin temperature and skin heat fluxes) are needed to predict core body temperature. In addition, the physiological measurements chosen in this study and the algorithm defined in this work are potentially applicable as real-time core body temperature monitoring to assess health risk in broad range of working conditions.},

Metabolic rate (VO2) was determined by the Douglas bag method. Heart rate was sampled continuously. Skin surface temperatures were measured at the forehead, chest and shoulder, and core temperatures in the deep esophagus and at the tympanic membrane using a radio telemetry system. For each outdoor experiment an indoor experiment in a climatic chamber, adjusted to the same air temperature but in still air, was performed. The subjects exercised at the same VO2 as in the outdoor trial on a stationary bicycle ergometer. Measurements were taken with the same equipment as in the outdoor experiments. O2-consumption (l.min-1) and heart rates (beats.min-1) were similar during outdoor and indoor bicycling, averaging 2.38 +/- 0.018 (SE) and 2.26 +/- 0.07, 141 +/- 7 and 147 +/- 8, respectively. During steady state Tes was the same during outdoor and indoor bicycling (37.95 degrees C), while Ttymp was significantly lower during outdoor bicycling. delta (Tes-Ttymp) was 1.25 degrees C during outdoor and 0.5 degrees C during indoor exercise. It is concluded that, if tympanic temperature is lowered by counter-current cooling of its arterial supply, then cooling of the brain may also take place in humans during physical activity under normal outdoor conditions with convective air movements. But the magnitude of a possible brain cooling cannot be deduced from the fall in tympanic temperature.},

  abstract = {Objective: Continuous temperature monitoring in high-risk patients can enable healthcare providers to remotely track patients' temperatures, promptly detect fevers and timely intervene to improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated if a novel wearable, continuous temperature monitor (Verily Patch) can reliably estimate body temperature and early detect fevers in an outpatient setting in patients at a high risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) who recently underwent chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Methods: 86 patients at a high risk for FN were prospectively enrolled at Mayo Clinic, MN. Patients wore the device in their axilla region for 7 days post ASCT and recorded self-measured oral temperatures every 3 hours. Patients were also followed using clinical standard-of-care procedures with daily oral temperature assessment. The clinic- and patient-assessed oral temperatures were used to develop and evaluate Verily Patch's body temperature and early fever detection algorithms using a K-fold cross-validation approach. Results: The Verily Patch reliably measured body temperatures with an error of 0.35 {$\pm$} 0.88\textdegree F in comparison to clinic- and patient-assessed oral temperatures. The sensitivity and specificity of the patch in detecting clinic-assessed fever episodes was 90.2\% and 87.8\%. The patch detected 14.3 times the number of clinic-assessed fever episodes with a median lead time of 4.3 hours. Conclusion: Patient self-monitoring of temperature and fever incidents suffers from low accuracy and is impractical for extended periods of time. Continuous temperature monitoring by a wearable device (such as Verily Patch) has the potential to overcome these challenges resulting in better patient clinical outcomes and more cost-effective care.},

  abstract = {Microsleep, caused by sleep deprivation, sleep apnea, and narcolepsy, costs the U.S.'s economy more than \$411 billion/year because of work performance reduction, injuries, and traffic accidents. Mitigating microsleep's consequences require an unobtrusive, reliable, and socially acceptable microsleep detection solution throughout the day, every day. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not meet these requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel behind-the-ear wearable device for microsleep detection, called WAKE. WAKE detects microsleep by monitoring biosignals from the brain, eye movements, facial muscle contractions, and sweat gland activities from behind the user's ears. In particular, we introduce a Three-fold Cascaded Amplifying (3CA) technique to tame the motion artifacts and environmental noises for capturing high fidelity signals. The behind-the-ear form factor is motivated by the fact that bone-conductance headphones, which are worn around the ear, are becoming widely used. This technology trend gives us an opportunity to enable a wide range of cognitive monitoring and improvement applications by integrating more sensing and actuating functionality into the ear-phone, making it a smarter one. Through our prototyping, we show that WAKE can suppress motion and environmental noise in real-time by 9.74-19.47 dB while walking, driving, or staying in different environments ensuring that the biosignals are captured reliably. We evaluated WAKE against gold-standard devices on 19 sleep-deprived and narcoleptic subjects. The Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation results show the feasibility of WAKE in microsleep detection on an unseen subject with average precision and recall of 76\% and 85\%, respectively.},

Based on a study on a cohort of 30 subjects with reference oral temperature, the proposed method showed a bias of 0.1 {$\pm$} 0.37 \textdegree C, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.29 {$\pm$} 0.25 \textdegree C. Another cohort of 22 subjects with continuous core body temperature pill as reference showed a bias of 0.16 {$\pm$} 0.38 \textdegree C and MAE of 0.42 {$\pm$} 0.22 \textdegree C.},

Our processing pipeline combines several existing approaches to clean noisy data and calculate respiratory rates on 20-second windows. In a study with twelve participants, we compare accelerometer and gyroscope based sensing and employ pressure-based measurement with nasal cannulas as ground truth. Our results indicate a mean absolute error of 2.62 CPM (acc) and 2.55 CPM (gyro). This overall accuracy is comparable to previous approaches using accelerometer-based sensing, but we observe a higher relative error for the gyroscope. In contrast to related work using other sensor positions, we can not report significant differences between the two modalities or the three postures standing, sitting, and lying on the back (supine). However, in general, performance varies drastically between participants.},

This new platform has spurred a wealth of new research exploring what can be detected on a wearable, small form factor. As a sensing platform, the ears are less susceptible to motion artifacts and are located in close proximity to a number of important anatomical structures including the brain, blood vessels, and facial muscles which reveal a wealth of information. They can be easily reached by the hands and the ear canal itself is affected by mouth, face, and head movements. We have conducted a systematic literature review of 271 earable publications from the ACM and IEEE libraries. These were synthesized into an open-ended taxonomy of 47 different phenomena that can be sensed in, on, or around the ear. Through analysis, we identify 13 fundamental phenomena from which all other phenomena can be derived, and discuss the different sensors and sensing principles used to detect them. We comprehensively review the phenomena in four main areas of (i) physiological monitoring and health, (ii) movement and activity, (iii) interaction, and (iv) authentication and identification. This breadth highlights the potential that earables have to offer as a ubiquitous, general-purpose platform.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We compared the readings of the GENIUS 3000A FirstTemp infrared thermometer with a conventional temperature probe (MON-A-THERM tympanic) placed in contact with the tympanic membrane. We also systematically evaluated user-dependent factors influencing the infrared readings. METHODS: In 100 postoperative patients we investigated the repeatability of the infrared measurements and the agreement with tympanic thermocouple probes in the contralateral ear regarding the degree of auditory canal contamination. In 20 volunteers we evaluated the influence of three factors: interval between consecutive measurements, dwell time in the auditory canal before reading the temperature, and positioning of the grip. Finally, we compared the infrared readings in the same ear of 20 different users who were not familiar with this new method. RESULTS: Comparison with the tympanic contact probes revealed a mean difference of -0.67 degree C (+/-0.65 degree C 2 SD). The infrared thermometer significantly underestimated the temperature of the thermocouple probes. Repeatability was +/-0.3 degree C. The presence of cerumen in the auditory canal had no influence on the infrared readings. Shortening of the interval between two consecutive readings (30 and 60 s.) led to increasing differences between the two measurements with the second reading decreasing. After positioning the infrared thermometer in the auditory canal 5 seconds before taking temperatures, the recorded temperatures were significantly lower compared to the immediate temperature recordings. Rotation of the device out of the telephone handle position led to an increasing lack of agreement between infrared thermometry and thermistor probes. In 20 inexperienced operators agreement with the thermocouple probe was -0.80 degree C (+/-0.60 degree C 2 SD) and repeatability was +/-0.6 degree C. CONCLUSION: Although easy to use, infrared thermometry requires careful handling and experienced users. To get optimal recordings, the time between consecutive measurements should not be less than 90 seconds. Recordings should be taken immediately after positioning the device in the auditory canal. Best results are obtained when the grip of the device follows the ramus mandibulae like a telephone handle. The lower readings of the infrared thermometer compared to tympanic contact-probes indicate that the obtained readings represent the temperature of the auditory canal rather than of the tympanic membrane itself.},

Methods: The subjects of this prospective, blinded, controlled study were runners 18 years or older who were triaged to the acute care medical area at the finish line for suspected hypothermia, hyperthermia, dehydration, or altered mental status. Rectal and tympanic temperatures were measured simultaneously in all subjects for whom rectal temperature measurement had been deemed necessary and recorded on separate data cards. Results: Of the 239 runners treated in the acute care medical area, 37 required rectal temperature measurement and were enrolled in the study. The mean rectal temperature was 38.45\textordmasculine{$\pm$}1.20\textordmasculine{} C (range, 35.9\textordmasculine{} to 41.5\textordmasculine{} C). The mean tympanic membrane temperature was 37.81\textordmasculine{$\pm$}.95\textordmasculine{} C (range, 36.3\textordmasculine{} to 40.4\textordmasculine{} C). Pearson's correlation coefficient revealed a moderate correlation (r=.6902, P=.00023). The mean temperature difference between the two thermometers, mean rectal minus mean tympanic membrane, was .64\textordmasculine{} C (95\% confidence interval, .35\textordmasculine{} to .93\textordmasculine{} C). Sixty-two percent of the tympanic membrane readings were within 1\textordmasculine{} C of their rectal counterparts. Agreement ranged from 1.16\textordmasculine{} (+2 SD) to -2.95\textordmasculine{} (-2 SD). The 95\% confidence interval was 1.67\textordmasculine{} to -2.95\textordmasculine{} C. Conclusion: We were able to demonstrate only a moderate correlation between the two thermometer readings, with a wide spread between the limits of agreement. This spread could be clinically significant and therefore limits the usefulness of tympanic temperature in the marathon race setting. Because of the potentially large and clinically significant differences in rectal and tympanic temperatures and the limitations inherent in our study, we cannot endorse the use of tympanic temperature in the setting of a marathon event.

  abstract = {Controversies surrounding tympanic temperature (Tty) itself and techniques for measuring it have dampened the potential usefulness of Tty in determining core temperature (operationally defined here as the body temperature taken at a deep body site). The present study was designed to address the following questions. 1) Can a tympanic membrane probe be made that is safer and more reliable than its predecessors? 2) Why is the effect of facial cooling and heating on Tty so inconsistent in reports from different laboratories? 3) Is Tty still useful as a measure of core temperature? Data from this study, obtained with a modified thermocouple probe, suggest that the widely reported facial skin cooling effect on Tty is most probably due to thermal contamination from the surrounding ear canal wall and/or suboptimal contact of the probe sensor with the tympanic membrane because 1) Tty that fell during facial cooling was increased to the precooling level by the repositioning of the probe sensor; 2) Tty determined by using a probe with a larger sensor area (the sensor soldered to a steel wire ring)tended to fall in response to facial cooling, whereas Tty determined with a thermally insulated probe ring did not; and 3) Tty obtained under careful positioning of the insulated probe was relatively insensitive to facial cooling or heating. Because Tty was practically identical to esophageal temperature (Tes) in the steady state, i.e., 36.83 +/- 0.20 (SD) degrees C for Tty and 36.87 +/- 0.16 degrees C for Tes at room temperature (n = 11), and because facial cooling had little effect on both Tty and Tes (36.86 +/- 0.17 degrees C for Tty and 36.86 +/- 0.26 degrees C for Tes during facial or scalp skin cooling), we support the postulate that Tty is a good measure of core temperature. The temperature transient in response to foot warming was detected 5 min (n = 2) faster with Tty than with Tes. Thus, with further improvements in the design of the probe. Tty can become a standard for determination of core body temperature.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was twofold: it (i) analyzed the weekly variations of sleep quality and training intensity of youth soccer players and (ii) analyzed the relationships between sleep quality and training intensity. This study followed an observational design. Twenty men youth players (age: 18.81 {$\pm$} 0.41 years) were monitored daily over two weeks for sleep quality and training intensity. Sleep quality was measured daily using the 15-item consensus sleep diary. The training intensity was measured daily using the CR-10 Borg's scale as a measure of rate of perceived exertion (RPE); a heart rate (HR) sensor was used to measure minimum, average and peak; a global positioning system (GPS) was used for measuring the total distance covered and distances covered at different speed thresholds. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze the weekly variations of sleep quality and training intensity. The Pearson correlation test was executed to analyze the relationships between sleep quality and training intensity. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant within-week variations in sleep duration (hours) (p = 0.043), quality of sleep (p = 0.035), RPE (p = 0.007), session-RPE (p = 0.011), HRminimum (p = 0.027), HRpeak (p = 0.005), total distance (p {$<$} 0.001), pace (p {$<$} 0.002), distance covered at 3.00\textendash 6.99 km/h (p {$<$} 0.001), distance covered at 7.00\textendash 10.99 km/h (p {$<$} 0.001), distance covered at 11.00\textendash 14.99 km/h (p {$<$} 0.001), distance covered at 15.00\textendash 18.99 km/h (p {$<$} 0.001) and distance covered at {$>$}19.00 km/h (p {$<$} 0.001). Significant small correlations were found between sleep duration before training and session-RPE (r = 0.252), total distance (r = 0.205), distance covered at 3.00\textendash 6.99 km/h (r = 0.209) and distance covered at 7.00\textendash 10.99 km/h (r = 0.265). Significant small correlations were found between session-RPE and sleep duration after (r = 0.233), total distance and quality of sleep after (r = 0.198), distance at 3.00\textendash 6.99 km/h and quality of sleep after training (r = 0.220), distance covered at {$>$}19.00 km/h and quality of sleep after training (r = 0.286), session duration and rested feeling after training (r = 0.227), total distance and rested feeling after training (r = 0.202), distance covered at 11.00\textendash 14.99 km/h and rested feeling after training (r = 0.222) and distance covered at {$>$}19.00 km/h and rested feeling after training (r = 0.214). In conclusion, sleep duration was longer in the training sessions during the middle of the week; the training intensity was also greater (485.8 {$\pm$} 56.8 A.U.). Moreover, sleep outcomes after training were slightly correlated with both physiological and locomotor demands.},

This study aims to observe the evolution of heart rate (HR), core temperature (Tcore), and skin temperature (Tskin) in an intervallic program of exposure to extreme heat. Twenty-nine healthy male volunteers were divided into a control group (CG; n = 14) and an experimental group (EG; n = 15). EG experienced nine sessions (S) of intervallic exposure to high temperatures (100 {$\pm$} 2 \textdegree C), whereas CG was exposed to ambient temperatures (22 {$\pm$} 2 \textdegree C). HR, Tskin, and Tcore were monitored in S1, 4, 5, 8, and 9. An important increase in HR occurred in the S4 compared to the rest (p {$<$} 0.05) in EG. A lower HR was discovered in S8 and S9 compared to S4 and in S9 in relation to S1 (p {$<$} 0.05) in EG. EG experiences a gradual decrease in Tcore and Tskin, which was detected throughout the assessments, although it was only significant in the S8 and S9 (p {$<$} 0.05). Interval exposure to heat at 100 {$\pm$} 2 \textdegree C elicits stress on the human organism, fundamentally increasing Tcore, Tskin, and FC. This recurring stress in the full program caused a drop in the thermoregulatory response as an adaptation or acclimation to heat.},

  abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder worldwide and remains underdiagnosed. Its multiple associated comorbidities contribute to a decreased quality of life and work performance as well as an increased risk of death. Standard treatment seems to have limited effects on cardiovascular and metabolic aspects of the disease, emphasising the need for early diagnosis and additional therapeutic approaches. Recent evidence suggests that the dysregulation of circadian rhythms, processes with endogenous rhythmicity that are adjusted to the environment through various cues, is involved in the pathogenesis of comorbidities. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea, altered circadian gene expression patterns have been demonstrated. Obstructive respiratory events may promote circadian dysregulation through the effects of sleep disturbance and intermittent hypoxia, with subsequent inflammation and disruption of neural and hormonal homeostasis. In this review, current knowledge on obstructive sleep apnea, circadian rhythm regulation, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders is summarised. Studies that connect obstructive sleep apnea to circadian rhythm abnormalities are critically evaluated. Furthermore, pathogenetic mechanisms that may underlie this association, most notably hypoxia signalling, are presented. A bidirectional relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm dysregulation is proposed. Approaching obstructive sleep apnea as a circadian rhythm disorder may prove beneficial for the development of new, personalised diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic tools. However, further studies are needed before the clinical approach to obstructive sleep apnea includes targeting the circadian system.},

  abstract = {The Stroop test is one of the most widely used protocols to induce cognitive stress and reliably activates the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). However, it only moderately activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the stress axis responsible for cortisol secretion. In other well-known stress protocols, such as the cold pressor test, adding social-evaluative elements to the regular procedure has proven to cause increased HPA axis activation. For this reason, we introduce the ``Stroop Competition'', a novel stress protocol based on the established Stroop test that adds social-evaluative feedback by conducting the test against a fake opponent with subsequent performance evaluation. We investigated the stress response of 22 participants performing either the ``Stroop Competition'' (Competition group) or the regular Stroop test (Control group) three consecutive times. Stress responses were assessed using ECG recordings to extract heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) and saliva samples to extract salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and cortisol. In the Competition group, participants experienced higher SNS activation indicated by significantly higher HR and lower HRV levels as well as higher sAA response to the stressor compared to the Control group. Additionally, overall cortisol levels were significantly higher in the Competition group supporting higher HPA axis activity. The findings of our pilot study confirm our hypothesis that adding social-evaluative elements to the Stroop test causes a more effective activation of both the SNS and HPA axis. We are convinced that our novel ``Stroop Competition'' protocol will provide a valuable addition to the already existing stress protocols in biopsychological research.},

The availability of information about daily physiological state and activity makes it possible to judge the health condition and provide predictive diagnosis and treatment. A wireless sensing system for monitoring physiological information in the living environment was developed and its functions were evaluated. The system consists of ear-worn temperature sensors, thermo-hygrometers, skin temperature sensors, and an ECG sensor with accelerometer. Data could be obtained in daily life without restraining wearers' movements using multiple networked wearable sensors with a reasonable battery life. The level of data loss in wireless communication was low making it possible to estimate physiological state, even though both the IEEE 802.15.4 radio and the low power radio coexist. The system was evaluated for the prevention of heat stroke and unwellness during exercise monitoring real-time thermal physiological state with ambient temperature and humidity. Experiments showed that the detection of the abnormal level of physiological data and its change was effective in judging the physiological state and giving a warning on the health condition in the context of activity and surroundings.},

TeethTap adopts a wearable 3D printed earpiece with an IMU sensor and a contact microphone behind both ears, which works in tandem to detect jaw movement and sound data, respectively. TeethTap uses a support vector machine to classify gestures from noise by fusing acoustic and motion data, and implements K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) with a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measurement using motion data for gesture classification. A user study with 11 participants demonstrated that TeethTap could recognize 13 gestures with a real-time classification accuracy of 90.9\% in a laboratory environment. We further uncovered the accuracy differences on different teeth gestures when having sensors on single vs. both sides. Moreover, we explored the activation gesture under real-world environments, including eating, speaking, walking and jumping. Based on our findings, we further discussed potential applications and practical challenges of integrating TeethTap into future devices.},

  abstract = {Even though there are indications that stress influences body temperature in humans, no study has systematically investigated the effects of stress on core and peripheral body temperature. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the effects of acute psychosocial stress on body temperature using different readout measurements. In two independent studies, male and female participants were exposed to a standardized laboratory stress task (the Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) or a non-stressful control task. Core temperature (intestinal and temporal artery) and peripheral temperature (facial and body skin temperature) were measured. Compared to the control condition, stress exposure decreased intestinal temperature but did not affect temporal artery temperature. Stress exposure resulted in changes in skin temperature that followed a gradient-like pattern, with decreases at distal skin locations such as the fingertip and finger base and unchanged skin temperature at proximal regions such as the infra-clavicular area. Stress-induced effects on facial temperature displayed a sex-specific pattern, with decreased nasal skin temperature in females and increased cheek temperature in males. In conclusion, the amplitude and direction of stress-induced temperature changes depend on the site of temperature measurement in humans. This precludes a direct translation of the preclinical stress-induced hyperthermia paradigm, in which core temperature uniformly rises in response to stress to the human situation. Nevertheless, the effects of stress result in consistent temperature changes. Therefore, the present study supports the inclusion of body temperature as a physiological readout parameter of stress in future studies.},

  abstract = {As a result of the inefficiency of metabolic transfer, {$>$}75\% of the energy that is generated by skeletal muscle substrate oxidation is liberated as heat. During exercise, several powerful physiological mechanisms of heat loss are activated to prevent an excessive rise in body core temperature. However, a hot and humid environment can significantly add to the challenge that physical exercise imposes on the human thermoregulatory system, as heat exchange between body and environment is substantially impaired under these conditions. This can lead to serious performance decrements and an increased risk of developing heat illness. Fortunately, there are a number of strategies that athletes can use to prevent and/or reduce the dangers that are associated with exercise in the heat. In this regard, heat acclimatisation and nutritional intervention seem to be most effective. During heat acclimatisation, the temperature thresholds for both cutaneous vasodilation and the onset of sweating are lowered, which, in combination with plasma volume expansion, improve cardiovascular stability. Effective nutritional interventions include the optimisation of hydration status by the use of fluid replacement beverages. The latter should contain moderate amounts of glucose and sodium, which improve both water absorption and retention.},

  abstract = {Core body temperature (CBT) is an important and commonly used indicator of human health and endurance performance. A rise in baseline CBT can be attributed to an onset of flu, infection or even thermoregulatory failure when it becomes excessive. Sites which have been used for measurement of CBT include the pulmonary artery, the esophagus, the rectum and the tympanic membrane. Among them, the tympanic membrane is an attractive measurement site for CBT due to its unobtrusive nature and ease of measurement facilitated, especially when continuous CBT measurements are needed for monitoring such as during military, occupational and sporting settings. However, to-date, there are still polarizing views on the suitability of tympanic membrane as a CBT site. This paper will revisit a number of key unresolved issues in the literature and also presents, for the first time, a benchmark of the middle ear temperature against temperature measurements from other sites. Results from experiments carried out on human and primate subjects will be presented to draw a fresh set of insights against the backdrop of hypotheses and controversies.},
